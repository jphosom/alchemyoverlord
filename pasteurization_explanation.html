<h3>Pasteurization and Pasteurization Units</h3>
<h4>What is Pasteurization</h4>
<p>
Pasteurization (named after Louis Pasteur) is a heat-treatment process
that kills yeast and at least some bacteria (e.g. <em>Lactobacillus</em> and
<em>Acetobacter</em>) in a (usually liquid) food product. 
The goal of pasteurization is to kill enough of the microbes so that the
product is stable for several months to a year or so. This contrasts
with sterilization, where the goal is to completely kill all microbes.
When pasterurizing, a liquid is heated to a specific temperature for a 
specific period of time to produce a certain reduction in the microbial
population.
While both pasteurization and sterilization are heat treatments to
kill microbes, the lower temperatures of pasteurization 
are better at preserving flavors and nutrients.
</p><p>
The <em>amount</em> of pasteurization that is applied to a product is 
measured using Pasteurization Units (PUs).
Pasteurization Units indicate how much thermal "force" is applied
to a product to reduce the  microbial population, but they don't tell us
by how much the population is reduced.  Some microbes are stronger
than others and can resist more of this force.
In order to compute the reduction in the population of microbes,
one needs to know both the level of pasteurization
(in PUs) and the decimal reduction time, called the 
<em>D</em> value,
that is associated with those microbes in this liquid environment,
as explained below.
If you know the required number of PUs for a product, you can determine 
the time and temperature needed to reach that level of pasteurization, 
even if you don't know the <em>D</em> value.
</p><p>
In this tutorial, the mathematical concept of power
(<em>x<sup>y</sup></em>) is important, in particular the power of 10 
(10<sup><em>y</em></sup>). 
The exponent in a power equation specifies how many times the base (10)
is multiplied by itself; 10<sup>2</sup> is the same as 10&times;10 
and the exponent is 2. 
When the exponent is 4, then 10<sup>4</sup> is the same as 
10&times;10&times;10&times;10 or 10,000.  
Exponents don't need to be integers; for example 10<sup>2.5</sup> is 316.23.
The other math used here is limited to addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and 
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-integration-new/ab-6-3/a/review-summation-notation" target="_top">summation</a>.  
Summation is indicated by the &sum; symbol.  Capitalization is important
in the variable names: <em>T</em> (representing temperature) is different 
from <em>t</em> (representing time).
</p>
<h4>The <em>D</em> Value and the Reduction in Microbial Population</h4>
<p>
The 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-value_(microbiology)" target="_top"><em>D</em> value</a>
is a numerical description of how heat-tolerant
the microbes are; less heat-tolerant microbes will be killed off more
quickly than more heat-tolerant ones.
The <em>D</em> value is defined as the time it takes, in minutes, to reduce 
(or divide) a microbial population by a factor of 10 at a specific temperature.
This value depends on the type of liquid being pasteurized and which organism
is in the liquid. 
It is common to indicate the target temperature (in
Celsius) for a <em>D</em> value using a subscript, such as 
<em>D</em><sub>60</sub> = 4.0.
</p><p>
The <em>D</em> value is determined experimentally by adding one microbe species
(e.g. <em>Lactobacillus brevis</em>) to a target product (e.g. beer)
and measuring the population change at a target temperature.
If <em>D</em> has been determined to be 4.0 at 140&deg;F (60&deg;C) for
one microbe species in a product, then (by definition) it takes 4 minutes 
to reduce the population of that microbe by a factor of 10 at that temperature.  
Another 4 minutes will reduce the remaining population by another factor of 10.
</p><p>
For example, if there are 100,000 live microbes floating around in your 
liquid, then holding that liquid at 140&deg;F (60&deg;C) for 4 minutes 
(when <em>D</em><sub>60</sub>=4.0 for those microbes) will result in
10,000 live microbes.  
Holding for another 4 minutes will result in another factor of 10 and only 
1,000 live microbes, or a total reduction by a factor of 100.  
Mathematically, we can express this relationship by saying
<center>
final population = initial population / 10<sup><em>t</em>/<em>D</em></sup>
</center>
where <em>t</em> is the amount of time (in minutes) that the liquid is held 
at the temperature associated with <em>D</em>.
In the example above, holding for a total of 8 minutes 
is equivalent to 2&times;<em>D</em><sub>60</sub>, and the
final population count equals the initial population divided by 
10<sup>8.0/4.0</sup>, which is the same as 10<sup>2</sup> or 100.  
A goal of 6&times;<em>D</em> or (6<em>D</em>) minutes is often cited 
as a desired target for pasteurization, reducing the microbial
population by a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> or 1,000,000. 
If <em>D</em><sub>60</sub> is 4.0, then the liquid would have to be held 
at this reference temperature for 24 minutes to reduce the population by 
a factor of one million.
</p><p>
<h4>Pasteurization Units and the <em>z</em> Value</h4>
Pasteurization Units (PUs) are a numerical description of the relative
amount of microbial destruction that occurs when heat-treating a product
using a combination of time and temperature.
The number of PUs is the numerator in the exponent of the equation
that relates final population to initial population.  
The numerator in the above equation is <em>t</em> and so in the above case
<center><em>PU</em> = <em>t</em>.</center>
Increasing the number of PUs will exponentially increase the destruction 
of microbes.
Holding the liquid at the reference temperature for 24 minutes yields 24 PUs
(no matter what the <em>D</em> value is),
and when <em>D</em> = 4.0 that will reduce the microbial population 
by a factor of 1,000,000.
One PU is often defined as the result of holding a liquid at a reference 
temperature for one minute.  
(The unit of PUs is minutes, but PUs are not the same as time.  PUs
measure the combination of time and temperature that impacts
microbial population.)
</p><p>
This is where things get more interesting.  We can revise these
equations in such a way that we can change the actual temperature 
that we hold the liquid at, and still determine the amount of pasteurization 
(the number of PUs) at this new temperature using information based
on the original reference temperature.
The revised definitions are: 
<center>final population = initial population / 10<sup><em>PU</em> / <em>D</em></sup></center>
<center><em>PU</em> = <em>t</em> &times; <em>L<sub>T</sub></em></center>
where
<center><em>L<sub>T</sub></em> = 10<sup>(<em>T</em>&minus;<em>T<sub>ref</sub></em>)/<em>z</em></sup></center>
and where <em>T</em> is the actual temperature applied to the product, 
<em>T<sub>ref</sub></em> is the reference temperature for the <em>D</em> value, 
and 
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-value_(temperature)" target="_top">z</a></em>
is the increase in temperature that will result in decreasing 
the <em>D</em> value by a factor of 10.
In short, we have added a new temperature-dependent variable, 
<em>L<sub>T</sub></em>, which is 1.0 at the reference temperature.
(The units of these variables may be a little tricky for those accustomed
to US-customary units (e.g. Fahrenheit).
While <em>L<sub>T</sub></em> can be evaluated using degress Fahrenheit 
for all variables, the conversion of <em>z</em> from Celsius to Fahrenheit 
should not add 32 because it represents a change in temperature. 
Celsius is more commonly used when talking about pasteurization and will be 
assumed here.)
</p><p>
It may be helpful to understand <em>L<sub>T</sub></em> through some
examples.  First, let's look at the case where <em>T</em> equals 
<em>T<sub>ref</sub></em>.  In this case, the difference is zero, and so
(<em>T</em> &minus; <em>T<sub>ref</sub></em>)/<em>z</em> is also zero.
Then, because 10<sup>0</sup> equals 1, when the actual temperature
equals the reference temperature, <em>L<sub>T</sub></em> equals 1, and
<em>PU</em> equals <em>t</em>.  
This shows that the extended formula is still consistent with the definition 
that 1 PU is equivalent to holding the liquid at the reference temperature
for one minute.
Next, let's consider the case
where <em>T</em> is larger than the reference temperature by <em>z</em>
degrees.  Then, <em>T</em> &minus; <em>T<sub>ref</sub></em> = <em>z</em>
and so (<em>T</em> &minus; <em>T<sub>ref</sub></em>)/<em>z</em> equals
one.  Then <em>L<sub>T</sub></em> equals 10<sup>1</sup> or 10, and 
(<em>t</em> &times; 10) / <em>D</em> is the same as <em>t</em> / 
(<em>D</em> / 10), and so we have increased the temperature such that 
the <em>D</em> value (the time it takes to reduce the population by a 
factor of 10) has itself decreased by a factor of 10.  
This is also equivalent to reducing the time needed for a certain level 
of pasteurization by a factor of 10.  
If we get 24 PUs when <em>t</em> = 24.0 and <em>L<sub>T</sub></em> = 1.0, then
we also get 24 PUs when <em>t</em> = 2.4 and <em>L<sub>T</sub></em> = 10.0.
If we know the value of <em>z</em> and the reference temperature, we can 
easily determine any combination of time and temperature that will yield a 
certain level of pasteurization.
</p><p>
Looking at a few more examples may be helpful.  Using a <em>z</em> 
value of 6.94, a reference temperature for <em>D</em> of 140&deg;F (60&deg;C), 
and holding a cider at 158&deg;F (70&deg;C) for one minute 
will produce 27.6 PUs, because 10<sup>((70-60)/6.94)</sup> = 27.6.
Holding this cider at 131&deg;F (55&deg;C) for 60 minutes will produce 11.4 PUs 
(60 &times; 10<sup>((55-60)/6.94)</sup> = 11.4).  If we want 50 PUs,
we can get that using one minute of pasteurization at 161.2 &deg;F 
(71.8&deg;C) or four minutes at 153.7&deg;F (67.6&deg;C).  
(In this case, <em>T</em> = (log(<em>PU<sub>target</sub></em> / 
<em>t</em>) &times; <em>z</em>) + <em>T<sub>ref</sub></em>).
If we want 50 PUs with a target temperature of 149&deg;F (65.0&deg;C), 
then we'll need 9.5 minutes (<em>t</em> = <em>PU<sub>target</sub></em> /
10<sup>(<em>T</em>-<em>T<sub>ref</sub></em>)/<em>z</em></sup>).
</p><p>
The <em>z</em> value, like the <em>D</em> value, depends on the type of 
liquid being pasteurized and which organism is being targeted.
The <em>z</em> value is determined experimentally by adding one microbe 
species to the product, measuring the population change at several target 
temperatures to determine <em>D</em> at several temperatures, and finding 
the increase in temperature that reduces <em>D</em> by a factor of 10.
</p>

<h4>Pasteurization Changes with Temperature</h4>
<p>
So far, we have considered holding a product at a single temperature for
some period of time <em>t</em>.
The same concepts can be applied to holding the product at different
temperatures over a period of time, for example as the product heats up 
and cools down.
Above we defined <em>PU</em> as 
<em>t</em> &times; <em>L<sub>T</sub></em> which is the same as 
<em>t</em> &times; 10<sup>(<em>T</em>&minus;<em>T<sub>ref</sub></em>)/<em>z</em></sup>.
We can break the time period <em>t</em> down into one-minute increments, 
like this:
<em>t</em> = 1 + 1 + ... + 1, where this addition happens <em>t</em> times,
and represent that with summation: <em>t</em> = &sum;<sup><em>t</em></sup> 1.
(The superscript <em>t</em> above the &sum; indicates that the summation
happens <em>t</em> times, and summing 1 <em>t</em> times yields the
value <em>t</em>.)
Then we can consider the temperature  at each of these individual times, 
<em>T<sub>m</sub></em>, where <em>m</em> is a one-minute time interval
within the total time <em>t</em>.  In this case, the definition of 
<em>L<sub>T</sub></em> undergoes a very minor change, where <em>T</em> becomes 
<em>T<sub>m</sub></em> to indicate that the temperature is now for a
specific time (minute) <em>m</em>:  
<center><em>L<sub>T<sub>m</sub></sub></em> = 10<sup>(<em>T<sub>m</sub></em>&minus;<em>T<sub>ref</sub></em>)/<em>z</em></sup></center>
We can now write the formula for <em>PU</em> with the temperature at 
each one-minute interval, by combining the summation over each minute with 
<em>L<sub>T<sub>m</sub></sub></em>:
<center>
<em>PU</em> = &sum;<sup><em>t</em></sup>
10<sup>(<em>T<sub>m</sub></em>&minus;<em>T<sub>ref</sub></em>)/<em>z</em></sup>
</center>
Now, at each time <em>m</em>, we use the temperature at this time, 
<em>T<sub>m</sub></em>, to compute <em>L<sub>T<sub>m</sub></sub></em>,
and then add up all of these values of
<em>L<sub>T<sub>m</sub></sub></em> for each minute in the total time
interval <em>t</em> to get <em>PU</em>.
(If a different time interval than one minute is used, this will
change the equation slightly.  A one-minute interval is commonly used
for simplicity.)
</p><p>
Again, some examples may help. In the simplest case, <em>T<sub>m</sub></em> 
is the same as <em>T<sub>ref</sub></em> at all times, and according to the 
new formula, <em>PU</em> still equals <em>t</em>.  
In a more complicated example, let's say that we apply heat treatment to 
the product for 5 minutes.  
Let's also say that <em>T<sub>ref</sub></em> = 60, <em>D</em> = 5.6 minutes, 
and <em>z</em> = 6.94.
During the first minute, the heat is still increasing and 
<em>T</em><sub>1</sub> = 57&deg;C.
During the second and third minutes, the heat is held at 65&deg;C, so 
<em>T</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>T</em><sub>3</sub> = 65&deg;C.
At the start of the fourth minute, the heat is turned off and the 
product starts to cool down.  Then, <em>T</em><sub>4</sub> = 61&deg;C 
and <em>T</em><sub>5</sub> = 59&deg;C.  With this information, we know that
<em>L<sub>T<sub>1</sub></sub></em> = 10<sup>&minus;3.0/6.94</sup> = 0.37, 
<em>L<sub>T<sub>2</sub></sub></em> and <em>L<sub>T<sub>3</sub></sub></em> = 
10<sup>5/6.94</sup> = 5.25, 
<em>L<sub>T<sub>4</sub></sub></em> = 10<sup>1/6.94</sup> = 1.39, and
<em>L<sub>T<sub>5</sub></sub></em> = 10<sup>&minus;1/6.94</sup> = 0.72.  
The total amount of pasteurization is the sum of all of these 
<em>L<sub>T</sub></em> values, or 0.37 + 5.25 + 5.25 + 1.39 + 0.72 = 12.98 PUs. 
(A real-life calculation of PUs is much more easily done using a
<a href="pasteurization.html">pasteurization units calculator</a>.)
With a <em>D</em> value of 5.6, we have reduced the microbial population 
by a factor of 10<sup>12.98/5.6</sup> = 10<sup>2.32</sup> or 208.  
If there were originally 100,000 microbes, after this heat treatment there 
are only 480 microbes.  This reduction by a factor of 208 or 2.32<em>D</em>
is still far short of the typical goal of a 6<em>D</em> reduction 
(with 33.6 PUs for a factor of 1,000,000).
</p><p>
</p>
<h4>Temperature Limits</h4>
<p>
Increasing the temperature above the reference temperature will rapidly 
increase the destruction of microbes during each minute of heat treatment.  
Similarly, decreasing the temperature will cause fewer microbes to be 
killed each minute.  How low can we make this temperature until the microbes 
are "uncomfortably warm" but not being killed by the heat treatment?  
In other words, what is the lower temperature limit for pasteurization? 
A minimum pasteurization temperature of 140&deg;F (60&deg;C) is sometimes 
recommended because it is around this temperature that
<a href="https://foodmicrobe-basic.com/pasteurization-d-z-values-guide/" 
target="_top">proteins undergo irreversible denaturation</a>.  (This
is the same temperature as the reference temperature in this tutorial's 
examples.) But is this the lowest temperature at which PU values accumulate?
</p><p>
Grzegorz (Greg) Rachon at <a href="https://www.campdenbri.co.uk/" target="_top">Campden BRI</a> 
(Rachon, 2019) used a peak temperature of 129&deg;F (54&deg;C) to 
achieve more than a 6<em>D</em> reduction in the microbial population by 
heat treatment with 1.6 PUs.
The target microorganism was <em>Lactobacillus brevis</em> in beer, 
with a reference temperature of 140&deg;F (60&deg;C), a <em>D</em> value 
of 0.2 minutes, and a <em>z</em> value of 9.48&deg;C.  The peak temperature 
was held for one minute, producing 0.23 PUs, and so the other 1.37 PUs 
were achieved during the 45-minute heating-up and 45-minute cooling-down 
periods, with a minimum temperature of 95&deg;F (35&deg;C).
In this case, the observed reduction in microbial
population (as part of a validation step) was actually larger than 
the computed reduction, indicating that temperatures between 95&deg;F (35&deg;C)
and 129&deg;F (54&deg;C) are sufficient to greatly reduce the microbial 
population, even for heat-resistant microorganisms.
</p><p>
Splittstoesser et. al (1975) looked at 29 yeasts and 5 lactic acid
bacteria (LAB) in wine (12% ABV).  Most of the yeasts had <em>D</em> values 
less than 0.6 minutes at 120&deg;F (49&deg;C), with the largest <em>D</em> value 
of 1.6 minutes at 120&deg;F (49&deg;C).
Four of the five LAB were less heat-tolerant than the yeasts, with
<em>D</em> values less than or equal to 0.35 minutes at 113&deg;F (45&deg;C).  
The bacterium <em>Lactobacillus fructivorans</em> behaved differently, however,
with a <em>D</em> value of 1.7 minutes at 140&deg;F (60&deg;C) and a 
<em>z</em> value of 12&deg;F (6.67&deg;C).  
At 136&deg;F (58&deg;C), the <em>D</em> value was about 3.2 minutes. 
(If the changes in <em>D</em> values were linear, the two values 
would imply a <em>z</em> value of 20&deg;C.  Apparently, at low temperatures 
the <em>D</em> values do not change linearly for this microbe.)
(The authors also found an inverse relationship between <em>D</em>
values and ethanol concentration; higher-alcohol products result
in smaller <em>D</em> values.)
Wikipedia states that <em>L. fructivorans</em> can grow in temperatures
as high as 53&deg;C and is very tolerant of both heat and ethanol.
By way of analogy, <em>L. fructivorans</em> is like a human who is most
comfortable when relaxing in a hot tub with a bottle of whiskey in hand.
</p><p>
In short, the minimum temperature for accumulating PUs depends, like
the <em>D</em> and <em>z</em> values, on the specific microbe and its
environment.  A temperature limit of 140&deg;F (60&deg;C) seems
too high for the vast majority of microbes; lower temperatures can often
still cause a reduction in micorobial population by a factor of 10 in 
just a few minutes.
However, for the general case, a lower limit of 131&deg;F (55&deg;C) seems to 
be a conservative value that should be effective even for microbes 
such as <em>L. fructivorans</em>.
</p>
<h4>Target PUs</h4>
<p>
When computing PUs, we want to use the <em>D</em> and <em>z</em> values 
(and the minimum temperature) for the most heat-tolerant microbes that 
may be found in the product.  
Microbes that are not as heat tolerant will usually end up with lower
population levels and will have less impact on the product shelf life.
The <em>D</em> and <em>z</em> values are dependent not only on the type 
of microbe, but also the environment that this microbe is in (the product). 
The initial population count commonly found in a product will also depend on 
many factors. For example, raw unfiltered apple juice will have a different 
initial population count than apple juice that has been treated with
potassium metabisulfite.  The shelf life will also depend on various factors,
such as the product's pH, the ethanol concentration, and if sugar has 
been added to the product.  
</p><p>
The recommended number of pasteurization units therefore depends on the 
product and the specifics of how it was produced.
For example, it has been recommended that pilsner and lager beer should 
have 15 to 25 PUs, ales and stouts should have 20 to 35 PUs, lemonade 
should have 300 to 500 PUs, and fruit juices should have 3000 to 5000 PUs.  
These recommended target PUs make assumptions about how the product has been
made and treated, and what microbes are in the product.
The target of 5000 PUs mentioned for fruit juices implies the presence of very 
heat-tolerant microbes with a very large <em>D</em> value and/or a 6<em>D</em>
reduction being insufficient due to a very high initial concentration 
of microbes.
</p><p>
If we know the <em>D</em> value and accept a 6<em>D</em> reduction as a 
reasonable goal, then the target PU level is easily computed as 
<em>PU<sub>target</sub></em> = 6 &times; <em>D</em>.  
The difficulty is in selecting the appropriate <em>D</em> value.
For beer, a <em>D</em> value of 5.6 minutes is associated with a 
commonly-used <em>z</em> value of 6.94 that was determined from a 
study by Del Vecchio, Dayharsh, and Baselt back in 1951.  Therefore, for 
beer we would want to target 5.6 &times; 6 or 33.6 PUs.  
More recent studies (e.g. Rachon, 2019) have demonstrated that this 
<em>D</em> value is probably much larger than needed for even heat-tolerant 
microbes in beer, and that as little as 1.2 PUs (with <em>D</em>=0.2 minutes) 
is sufficient for a 6<em>D</em> reduction in a beer's microbial population.
To further muddy the waters, a target of more than 10.2 PUs may be required 
for a 6<em>D</em> reduction in <em>L. fructivorans</em>, with the exact 
target depending on the product's pH and ethanol concentration.
There are sometimes no official recommendations on a target PU level for
a specific product; lacking such recommendations you need to understand and 
weigh the risks and benefits yourself.
</p>
<h4>Pasteurization and Botulism</h4>
<p>
Botulism is an illness caused by ingestion of the toxin that is produced when
the bacterium <em>Clostridium botulinum</em> grows from a spore to a 
full-fledged bacterium. <em>Clostridium botulinum</em> is very hardy
and commonly found in the soil and on many food surfaces.
A temperature of 176&deg;F (80&deg;C) for 30 minutes is required to
destroy the toxin, and a temperature of 250&deg;F (121&deg;C) for 3
minutes is required to kill the spores.  Pasteurization is therefore
ineffective at preventing botulism spores from producing the toxin.
However, <em>Clostridium botulinum</em> doesn't grow, and the toxin is 
not formed, when the pH is below 4.6.  Therefore, pasteurization is 
considered sufficient heat treatment for anything with a pH less than 4.6.  
For products with higher pH levels, pressure cooking (which can reach
temperatures above 212&deg;F (100&deg;C)) is required.
</p>
<h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
<p>
Estimating the final microbial population count that results from
pasteurization requires knowing the initial microbial population, 
the level of pasteurization (in PU), and the <em>D</em> value.  
We usually don't know the initial population, but the goal is usually 
to reduce this population by a factor of 1,000,000 or 6<em>D</em>.  
Sometimes it's unclear what <em>D</em> value to use,
as this value depends on not only the characteristics 
of the product (pH, ethanol concentration, sugar concentration) but
also the microbes that may be found in the product.
</p><p>
If the target PU level is known, then pasteurization can sucessfully
reach this level knowing only the reference temperature and the
<em>z</em> value that is associated with this product and its potential
microbes; the initial population count and the <em>D</em> value
are not needed.
A commonly-used reference temperature is 140&deg;F (60&deg;C) 
and <em>z</em> values often range from about 5 to about 10, although
a <em>z</em> value of 15.8 has been estimated for alcohol-free beer.
