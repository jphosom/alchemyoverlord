  <h2>Retirement Calculator</h2>

  <p>This page provides a calculator for planning for expenses
  and income during (semi-)retirement years.
  It does not account for unexpected expenses or big-budget items.
  Because it is better to die with money in the bank than to be
  very old and have no money, the default values below are
  fairly conservative.  Feel free to change the values to be
  more optimistic or even more pessimistic, and see how that
  impacts the results.
  </p>

  <p>
  Calculations will run until the specified ages at which to
  stop calculations, or until the amount of savings is negative and
  expenses exceed income.  In reality, one would presumably
  adopt a more frugal lifestyle (or mortgage the house) if this
  situation were imminent, but this calculator is not sophisticated
  enough to model that.
  </p>

  <p>
  The values you enter here are stored on your local computer.
  They are not transmitted beyond your computer. This site
  does not use any of your personal information for any 
  reason whatsoever, other than to provide you with the calculated
  results.  If you wish your inputs to be removed from your 
  computer, click on the "clear all saved inputs" button at the 
  bottom of this page.  This will reset everything to default values.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you want to revert to the default value for an input, type 'd'
  or 'D' in that field.

  <h2>Footnotes</h2>
  <ol>
  <li id="basicExpensesStart">
      Non-healthcare expenses are usually higher just after retirement 
      and lower in later years.  This calculator assumes a constant
      decrease in expenses until a certain point in time, after which
      expeneses are constant.  For this input, estimate the expenses
      when starting retirement (which may be higher than your typical
      retirement expenses.)
  <li id="basicExpensesFinish">
      At a certain age, retirement expeneses are assumed to become more 
      constant, with less travel and splurging.  Estimate both (a) the age 
      of the younger person when expenses become constant and (b) the amount
      of expenses, without worrying about how inflation will impact these
      expenses.
  <li id="openMarket">
      The specified rate of healthcare-related inflation (under "Inflation
      and Adjusted Spending Power") is used to adjust the cost of
      open-market healthcare that is specified here.
  <li id="openMarketOOP">
      The open-market deductables can be quite high, possibly higher than
      one expects to spend on healthcare in one year.  Here, enter the
      estimated out-of-pocket healthcare cost per year and per person, 
      or if this amount is higher then the expected deductable, enter 
      the deductable amount.
  <li id="medicare">
      This calculator applies the expected rate of healthcare inflation 
      to the cost of Medicare Part B or Medicare Advantage that is entered 
      here.  This may be a conservative estimate, as Medicare costs may 
      not increase as quickly as private medical costs.
  <li id="medicareDVD">
      Medicare Part B does not currently include dental, vision, drugs,
      or long-term care costs.  If not choosing Medicare Advantage,
      estimate the annual costs of these items.
      Current out-of-pocket dental cleanings can be $100 to $200,
      and vision exams between $50 and $200.  The price of drugs and
      long-term care may vary widely.
  <li id="federalTaxRateIncome">
      While one's federal tax rate will change with income, this calculator 
      simplifies things with a single tax rate for all years.  
      For a more conservative estimate, enter the average expected tax 
      bracket during the initial years of retirement.  For a less conservative
      estimate, enter the effective tax rate over all retirement years.
  <li id="federalTaxRateCapitalGains">
      This calculator asks for the short-term capital gains tax rate only
      to give a more conservative estimate.  The actual tax rate will be
      a combination of short-term gains (with profits on assests re-invested) 
      and long-term gains.
  <li id="stateTaxRateIncome">
      While one's state tax rate will change with income, this calculator 
      simplifies things with a single tax rate for all years.  
      For a more conservative estimate, enter the average expected tax 
      bracket during the initial years of retirement.  For a less conservative
      estimate, enter the effective tax rate over all retirement years.
  <li id="stateTaxRateCapitalGains">
      Different states tax capital gains differently.  In Oregon, captial
      gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.  In
      Massachusetts, long-term capital gains are taxed at 5% and
      short-term capital gains are taxed at 12%.  This calculator asks 
      for the short-term capital gains tax rate only to give a more 
      conservative estimate.  The actual tax rate will be a combination 
      of short-term gains (with profits on assests re-invested) 
      and long-term gains.
  <li id="SStax">
      When working part-time during the initial years, one's income is
      subject to the social-security and medicare tax on earnings.  
      If one has an employer, usually this rate is 7.65% by the employee 
      and 7.65% by the employer.  If one is self-employed, this rate
      is 15.30%.
  <li id="inflationRate">
      The Federal Reserve claims to target an average 2% annual inflation rate.
      If you believe they will succeed in that goal, change the value to 2.0%.
  <li id="healthcareInflation">
      The default assumes that healthcare expenses will increase twice as
      fast as general inflation.
  <li id="COLA">
      While the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is currently
      approximately the same as the rate of inflation, the default value here
      assumes that the COLA will not be maintained at this rate, but become
      lower.  For a less conservative estimate, you can set the COLA
      value to be the same as the average expected rate of inflation.
  <li id="SSpayout">
      Social Security is expected to run out of money in 2033.  There are
      several scenarios for handling this.  One option is a reduced payout.
      The default assumes a 70% payout starting in 2033.
  <li id="totalInvestments">
      This calculator assumes that any year in which income is greater than
      expenses, that difference is added back in to the total post-tax
      investments.  Total post-tax investments include cash, stocks, bonds, 
      and Roth IRAs.  While the investment earnings on Roth IRAs are not taxed,
      this calculator includes Roth IRAs as a taxed investment for simplicity.
  <li id="investmentYield">
      This is the overall yield from all types of assets.  "Cash" (i.e. 
      money market, high-yield savings) will have very little yield (maybe 2%).
      Stocks will have on average the highest yield (maybe 10%), but one 
      will generally want to have a portfolio with fewer and fewer stocks as 
      one gets older, to minimize risk.  The default value assumes a mix 
      of assets and a fairly conservative yield.
  <li id="SSbenefits">
      One can look up expected social-security benefits by logging in to 
      the social-security website.  Do *not* adjust the value from this
      website by the expected payout percentage due to insolvency, above.
      The calculator will do this for you.  One complicating factor is that 
      the social-security website assumes that you will continue working until 
      you start taking social security.  If you stop working before taking 
      social security payments, that will probably reduce your benefits.
      A very conservative estimate would be to assume that your benefits
      will be reduced by the fraction of years actually worked divided by the
      number of years that social-security uses in its model (35).
      So, if the website predicts that you will get $3000 per month at
      age 67, and you do not contribute to social security in a meaningful
      way beginning at age 60, your estimated benefit might be 3000 &times;
      (35 - (67 - 60))/35, or 80% of $3000, or $2400 per month.
  <li id="traditionalIRAs">
      Traditional IRAs and 401K accounts are treated the same for
      tax purposes: the amount added to the account is not taxed, and
      investment gains on that account are not taxed.  When you
      start withdrawing money, that withdrawl is taxed as income.
      Because of this, it makes sense to hold off on withdrawing from
      these accounts as long as possible (when one's income tax bracket
      is lower).  There are required minimum distributions, however,
      starting at age 72.  By default, this calculator withdraws money 
      from IRAs and 401K plans at the minimum amount until post-tax savings 
      are nearing depletion, at which point it withdraws the amount needed
      to pay expenses.  You can enter an age at which to start withdrawls,
      in which case it will withdraw amounts spread out as evenly
      as possible over time.
  <li id="traditionalIRAage">
      If the default value, "wait", is used, the calculator will wait
      as long as possible to withdraw money from IRA or 401K accounts,
      while respecting required minimum distributions.  If an age
      is specified, then the calculator will try to withdraw an 
      approximately equal amount each year.
  <li id="pension">
      This calculator assumes that pension payments are not adjusted for
      inflation, and that they are taxed as regular income.  If you
      expect to receive a pension, the estimated amount is assumed to be
      in dollars as of the year you start taking payments.
  <li id="other">
      One may expect to receive a significant one-time financial gain,
      for example from selling a house or inheriting an estate.  The
      amount here is the expected gain <em>after</em> paying any taxes.
