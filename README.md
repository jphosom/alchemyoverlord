This web page is devoted to calculators, blog posts, controlled experiments,
and tutorials related to beer and homebrewing.

## Site Highlights
The "highlights" of this site (in my opinion are):
* "A Summary of Factors Affecting IBUs" in my blog, which describes how
bitter compounds in beer are produced and affected by brewing techniques.
* "IBUs and the SMPH Model" in my blog and the SMPH calculator for
estimating the bitterness of beer.
* An interactive tutorial on the mathemetics behind sensory difference testing,
including triangle tests and three-alternative forced choice tests.
* A description of how I make hard cider and an associated calculator
for Pasteurization Units.
* A calculator for temperature correction of specific gravity, pH, and volume.
* A calculator for estimating the amount of calcium sulfate and calcium 
chloride to add when homebrewing.

## Blog Posts
My blogs posts are listed in the [Table of Contents](blog/toc/toc.html).
Over time, I've gravitated toward a "scientific publication" format for 
these posts, simply because I think it's effective at communicating the 
most information with the fewest words. With recent posts being a bit long, 
I don't want to drag the reader down with any unnecessary words, which 
unfortunately also leaves out a bit (or all??) of the fun. Behind all of 
the dull words and boring equations, I'm really interested in the high-level 
conclusions, and I hope you also find the overall topics interesting. 
Feel free to skip over any details that don't interest you; they're there 
in order to provide a solid foundation for the conclusions. 

## Calculators
My calculators are listed [here](summary.html).  The focus on calculators
for various methods of estimating IBUs (bitterness) in beer, and a variety
of other tools that I've found useful when brewing.  The tutorial on
sensory difference testing is included with these calculators.

I use GitHub mostly as a host for my .html files and javascript calculators.
There's nothing to install, although the code and datasets are visible
to anyone who might be interested.

## About
I earned my Ph.D. in computer science in 2000 (with a thesis on computer 
analysis of speech signals), and I started brewing beer in 2012.  I've 
taught graduate-level classes on computer speech recognition and 
performed research on health-related aspects of speech at Oregon Health and 
Science University.  After 10 years as a professor, I moved to the private 
sector, working on research and development of speaker verification and 
wakeword spotting systems.  I started brewing as a way to get a break from 
the keyboard, but my interest in beer-related programming and data analysis 
means that I now spend even more time in front of the computer.
