        <h2 id="Section1">1. Overview</h2>
        <p> The purpose of this web page is to explain and illustrate
          mathematical terms and processes for two types of perceptual
          difference tests, "triangle" and "3-alternative forced choice"
          (3-AFC). (A "perceptual difference test" is also called a
          "sensory difference test".) The topics covered here are not new,
          but I've tried to organize things into a beginning-to-end
          tutorial focused only on perceptual testing.</p>

        <p> To help explain things, this tutorial is set up as a series
          of interactive worksheets, with graphs that illustrate the
          effect of different parameter values. You can enter different
          values for some parameters and see in the graphs how the
          statistics change. You can also run simulations, which
          generate test data according to a model and analyze the
          results. If you use a positive simulation delay, test cases
          will be graphically generated and evaluated within this delay
          period. If you use a negative simulation delay, the per-sample
          graphics will be omitted, and the simulation will show only
          the summary results. The simulations depend on 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">pseudo-random numbers</a>; if you want to see the effect of changing the
          starting point for these pseudo-random numbers, change the
          value of "random number seed" (above) to any value you like
          between 0 and 10000.</p>

        <p> Disclaimer: I am not a statistician. While I am very
          familiar with a number of concepts and methods from
          statistics, having taught a small subset of statistical
          concepts for 10 years at the graduate level, the area of
          statistical significance testing sometimes seems like a game
          of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_in_Star_Trek#Fizzbin">Fizzbin</a>:
          just when you think you understand the rules, there's another
          exception or special case to consider. There has also been a 
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00259-019-04467-5#ref-CR19">
          vocal debate in many research communities</a> about the best
          methods for significance testing and evaluating results. This
          tutorial certainly won't settle any of that debate, and I'm
          not at all interested in debating points on which 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reasonableness">
          reasonable people may disagree</a>. This page is simply my attempt 
          to explain what I have learned about evaluating perceptual
          difference tests in a (hopefully) logical and intuitive
          manner.</p>

        <p> Although this tutorial discusses probabilities, the math
          used here is limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication,
          division, squaring, and the square root. A variable <em>x</em>
          when squared is notated as <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>, and the
          square root of <em>x</em> is notated as <em>x</em><sup>0.5</sup>.
          I use a number of variables to refer to things, and I
          sometimes use long variable names. I think that long variable
          names, such as "<em>R<sub>L(EE)</sub></em>", are easier to
          remember as meaning "the region of likely experimental error"
          than a shorter variable name such as "<em>r</em>". Longer
          names do not imply greater complexity; they are intended to be
          helpful. All variable names are, I hope, adequately explained
          below.</p>


        <h2 id="Section2">2. Objective Stimuli</h2>
        <p> In perceptual difference tests, we have two stimuli that will be
          evaluated. The stimuli might be two tones of different
          frequencies, two shades of color, or two samples of the same
          food with different levels of added sugar. The question we have
          is fairly straightforward: "Is there a perceptual difference
          between the two stimuli, or are they perceived as being the
          same?" The answer to this question is not straightforward, so
          we'll begin at the beginning by talking about the two
          (objective) stimuli.</p>

        <p> Focusing our example on the case of two foods with different
          levels of sugar, we'll call one of these samples "<b>A</b>"
          and the other one "<b>B</b>". The <b>A</b> sample might have
          more sugar then <b>B</b>, or vice versa; we might know that <b>A</b>
          has more sugar than <b>B</b>, or we might not know. We will
          assume that <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are consistently produced,
          and therefore that <b>A</b> always has the same, more, or
          less of some physical characteristic of interest than <b>B</b>.</p>

        <p> If we know, for example, that <b>B</b> has 200 mg more
          sugar than <b>A</b>, then this is a "known difference" case.
          In this case, we can plot samples of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>
          on a graph and label the X axis as "milligrams of sugar". We
          can also define this known difference (200 mg) as one
          "objective unit", and by this definition <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>
          are one unit apart.</p>

        <p> In another case, which we can call the "unknown difference"
          case, let's say that we have the same food produced by two
          manufacturers, and we suspect that one is sweeter than the
          other, but we don't know how much sugar or other sweetener is
          used in each. In this second case, we can label the X axis as
          "sweetener concentration", but we don't know what units to
          use. The actual concentration of ingredients isn't important,
          however, just the perceived difference (or lack thereof).
          Without knowing what units to use, we can still say that if <b>A</b>
          and <b>B</b> are physically different, that they differ by
          one unit. We will never know what this unit is physically
          measuring, but it doesn't really matter. We also don't know in
          advance if <b>A</b> is one unit greater than <b>B</b> or
          vice versa, but we do know that this difference will be
          consistent: <b>A</b> will always be one unit greater than <b>B</b>,
          or <b>B</b> will always be one unit greater than <b>A</b>.</p>

        <p> For simplicity, we will always plot <b>A</b> on the left
          and <b>B</b> on the right, implying that <b>B</b> has more
          of the physical characteristic(s) than <b>A</b>. If this is
          not true, then the locations of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> on the
          plots can be reversed; the conclusion of a perceptual
          difference (or lack thereof) will be the same. Because of our
          definitions, we plot <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> as being one unit
          apart, whether this is a case of a "known difference" or an
          "unknown difference". </p>

        <p> One sample each of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are plotted in
          Figure 1. This is a simple graph, with each line at a height
          of 1 (for one sample) and an X-axis difference between <b>A</b>
          and <b>B</b> of one objective unit. The sample of <b>A</b>
          is plotted at an arbitrary X-axis value of 0; subtraction can
          be used to map all X-axis values so that <b>A</b> is <em>always</em>
          located at 0 regardless of the original scale (e.g. 200-mg
          units of sugar). The sample of <b>B</b> is therefore plotted
          at an X-axis value of 1 unit.</p>

          scale. </center>
        <br>

        <h2 id="Section3">3. Internal Perceptual Measurement</h2>
        <p> Now we'll switch from the objective (physical) stimuli to our
          perception of these stimuli. What units or metrics should we use 
          to measure this perception (such as sweetness)?
          There will be some mapping from the physical stimulus (e.g.
          concentration of sugar) to the neural response to this stimulus.
          Humans have evolved to be very sensitive to some stimuli and
          rather insensitive to others. (In the case of bitterness, there
          is a very wide range of sensitivity levels between people, with
          some people being very sensitive (so-called "<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertaster">super tasters</a>")
          and others not so sensitive.) Since we're using a generic term
          "objective units" to describe the physical stimuli, we can use a
          similarly generic term, "perceptual units," to describe the
          sensory reaction to the stimuli. It doesn't matter if these
          perceptual units are in neural impulses per second or some other
          scale, as long as there is a direct (but possibly <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system">nonlinear</a>)
          mapping between objective units and perceptual units.
          For simplicity, we'll say that this direct mapping translates 
          objective units into perceptual units on the same scale, and 
          so <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are still one unit apart.</p>

        <p> When a person is given a sample (or stimulus) for
          evaluation, there are a number of factors that affect their
          perception of the sample. This change in their perception may
          be caused by general random variation in neural responses, 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory)">memory</a>
          and 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation">adaptation</a>
          effects, an unintended 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)">priming effect</a>, 
          or (for 
          <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/between-subjects-design">between-subjects studies</a>) 
          differences in people's sensitivity. Because of
          these factors, when we give subjects multiple samples of <b>A</b>,
          the perceived sweetness won't always be exactly at 0.0
          perceptual units; sometimes it will be higher, and sometimes
          lower. On average, though, <b>A</b> will have 0.0 perceptual
          units and <b>B</b> will have 1.0 perceptual units, and we say
          that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean">mean</a> 
          of <b>A</b> is 0.0 and the mean of <b>B</b> is 1.0. </p>

        <p> This is a good place to introduce probabilities, since
          probabilities allow us to talk about uncertain information
          such as perceived sweetness. There are 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability">
          different ways to define probability</a>, but the definition I'd 
          like to use is very practical: a probability is the relative
          frequency with which we <em>expect</em> an event to occur.
          Probabilities can be determined in one of two ways: by
          observation or by a model. Let's consider the example of a
          coin toss. I can flip a coin 100 times and collect data on how
          often I get heads and how often I get tails. Let's say that I
          get 48 heads and 52 tails. Based on these observations, I can
          estimate that the probability of heads (my expectation for
          getting heads in the future) is 48/100 or 0.48. Or, I can use
          a model that incorporates what I know about coin tosses and
          never use any data at all. In this case, knowing that there
          are two possibilities and no reason to favor one over the
          other, the probability of heads is 1/2 or 0.50. If I'm
          guessing the month you were born, a simple formula says that I
          have a probability of 1/12 (or 0.0833) of getting the correct
          answer. (A more complicated formula might account for the
          different number of days in each month.) Either way, we can
          refer to the probability of some event <em>x</em> as 
          <em>p</em>(<em>x</em>).  In this example, <em>p</em>(heads) 
          is either 0.48 or 0.50, depending on which method we use. </p>

        <p> For the type of model we'll talk about in this tutorial (namely a 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurstonian_model">Thurstonian model</a>), 
          we'll also assume that the perceived sweetness varies according to a 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a> 
          (also called a 
          <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html">bell curve</a>), 
          and so the probability of getting a certain level of perceived 
          sweetness can be described using the 
          <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html">standard deviation</a>
          of the perceived values, called sigma (represented with the Greek 
          letter <em>&sigma;</em> or the letter <em>s</em>).  The standard 
          deviation is a 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">measure of the amount of variation in a set of values</a>. 
          For simplicity, we'll also assume that the standard deviations for
          the perception of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are the same. (A
          normal distribution is commonly found in nature. If an event
          in nature (or perception) is the result of many independent
          processes, the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">central 
            limit theorem says that the resulting event will have a
            normal distribution</a>. In the case of bitterness, it would
          be better to model the perception as (at least) 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_distribution">bimodal</a>,
          or the summation of two (or more) normal distributions,
          reflecting both the variance within an individual and the
          different perceptual-unit means for "super-tasters" and less
          sensitive subjects. We can make things quite complicated, but
          for this explanation we'll try to keep things relatively
          simple.) </p>

        <p> If we know the standard deviation of perceived sweetness, we
          can plot the relative probability of a certain level of
          perceived sweetness when a subject is given sample <b>A</b>,
          and the relative probability of perceived sweetness given
          sample <b>B</b>. In mathematical notation, these probability
          functions are called <em>p</em>(<em>s</em> | <b>A</b>) and 
          <em>p</em>(<em>s</em> | <b>B</b>), where 
          <em>p</em>(<em>x</em> | <em>Y</em>) is
          the probability of some value <em>x</em> "given" some
          condition(s) <em>Y</em> and <em>s</em> is the perceived
          stimulus level. (The "|" or "given" notation in probabilities
          can be thought of as first constraining the world of
          possibilities so that <em>Y</em> is considered to be true.  
          This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability">conditional probability </a> 
          function tells us the probability of observing <em>x</em> 
          "under the condition" that <em>Y</em> is true.  For example, 
          <em>p</em>(sunshine | summer) is a large value in most places 
          in the world, whether it is currently summer or not.) The relative 
          probability of sweetness is described using the normal distribution 
          with mean value <em>&mu;</em> (using the Greek letter "mu") 
          and standard deviation <em>&sigma;</em>.  Therefore, we can say 
          <em>p</em>(<em>s</em> | <b>A</b>) = 
          <em>N</em>(<em>&mu;</em><sub><b>A</b></sub>, <em>&sigma;</em><sub><b>A</b></sub><sup>2</sup>) and 
          <em>p</em>(<em>s</em> | <b>B</b>) = <em>N</em>(<em>&mu;</em><sub><b>B</b></sub>, <em>&sigma;</em><sub><b>B</b></sub><sup>2</sup>)
          where <em>N</em>() is the normal distribution described by a
          mean <em>&mu;</em> and standard deviation <em>&sigma;</em>. We've
          already defined <em>&mu;<sub><b>A</b></sub></em> as 0.0 and 
          <em>&mu;<sub><b>B</b></sub></em> as 1.0, and 
          <em>&sigma;<sub><b>A</b></sub></em> has been defined as
          equal to <em>&sigma;<sub><b>B</b></sub></em>, so the only thing we
          need to decide on is the value of <em>&sigma;</em>. (I use the term
          "relative probability" to avoid a longer discussion about
          probabilities and probability density functions.) </p>

        <p> While we believe this model of perception to be true, we
          can't measure it directly. We can only measure cognitively
          higher-level responses to stimuli, and humans aren't very good
          at providing magnitude estimates of their perceptions. We're
          much better at communicating relative perceptions. This model
          is therefore called a 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable">latent</a>
          (or "hidden") model, because it can't be observed directly. </p>

        <p> An important concept in this model is that of <em>d'</em>
          (d prime), or the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_index">sensitivity index</a>. 
          Intuitively, <em>d'</em> is a measurement of how perceptually 
          different two stimuli are. If two stimuli are perceptually 
          indistinguishable, the <em>d'</em> value is 0. If two stimuli are 
          easily distinguished, the value of <em>d'</em> may be 4 or larger. 
          Mathematically, <em>d'</em> is defined as the difference between 
          the mean perceptual units of the two stimuli divided by the standard 
          deviation of the perception of these stimuli. We have conveniently 
          defined the difference between the means as always 1.0, and so in 
          our case <em>d'</em> is 1.0/&sigma;. 
          (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen's_d">Cohen's

           <em>d</em></a> effect size is the same as <em>d'</em>, in
          case you're familiar with effect size.) </p>

        <p> This leads to the concept of a 
          "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-noticeable_difference">just noticeable difference</a>", 
          or JND. The JND is the threshold at which a stimulus or change is 
          detected half the time. This forms an <a 
href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Measuring-Meaningful-Differences%3A-Sensory-Testing-Hout/110c8065c7a7848548f8041a4b763e848306027d">often-used
            threshold</a> for determining whether two stimuli are the
          same or different. In a 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-alternative_forced_choice">two-alternative forced-choice</a> 
          (2-AFC) task, if the two stimuli are identical then performance 
          will be 50% (reflecting random guessing). The JND is at 75% correct 
          in a 2-AFC task, halfway in between random guessing (50%) and 
          perfect identification (100%). A 75% correct response rate on a 
          2-AFC task corresponds with a <em>d'</em> value of 0.954, using 
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sensR/vignettes/methodology.pdf">a formula for this mapping</a>. 
          It is common to round <em>d'</em> up to 1.0, corresponding to 76% 
          correct on the 2-AFC task. </p>

        <p> By defining "perceptual difference" as a "just noticeable
          difference" or greater, we can now re-state the original
          question, "is there a perceptual difference between the two
          stimuli", in a more quantitative way: "is the <em>d'</em>
          value greater than (or equal to) 1?" The rest of these
          worksheets are designed to help answer this question about the
          value of <em>d'</em>. If we can use test results to
          conclude that <i>d'</i> is probably greater than or equal to
          1.0, that would be ideal. If we can use test results to
          conclude that <i>d'</i> is probably greater than 0, that
          would at least imply that the two stimuli are probably not
          perceptually identical.</p>

        <p> <a href="#Worksheet1">Worksheet 1</a> (below) plots the relative 
          probability of the perception of a stimulus (such as sweetness) 
          when a person is given samples of <b>A</b>, and the relative 
          probability of the perception of that stimulus given samples of 
          <b>B</b>.  This relative probability is taken from the normal
          distribution with standard deviation computed from the
          specified <em>d'</em>.
          The relative probability of each is maximum at the
          perceptual-unit mean of these samples (0.0 for <b>A</b>, 1.0
          for <b>B</b>). The more overlap there is between these
          probability functions for <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, the more
          difficult it is to distinguish one from the other. With a <em>d'</em>
          of 10.0, or a standard deviation of 0.1 perceptual units,
          there is effectively no overlap between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>,
          and one can easily perceive the difference between them. With
          a <em>d'</em> of 0.10, or a standard deviation of 10.0, there
          is almost no perceptual difference between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>;
          even though they are objectively different, they are perceived
          as being (practically) the same. </p>

        <p> In the entry next to "<em>d'</em> =" on the left of
          <a href="#Worksheet1">Worksheet 1</a>, you can enter different 
          values of <em>d'</em> and see <b>(a)</b> how much overlap there 
          is between the perception of the two stimuli, <b>(b)</b> what 
          the standard deviation (<em>&sigma;</em>) is, <b>(c)</b> the 
          probability of discrimination, <em>p<sub>d</sub></em>, (also 
          called the 
          <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329313000554">proportion of distinguishers</a>) 
          with a value of 0% for perceptually-identical stimuli and 100% for
          easily-distinguished stimuli, and <b>(d)</b> what the
          probability of correctly identifying <b>A</b> from <b>B</b>
          would be in a 2-AFC test, called <em>p<sub>2AFC</sub></em>. 
          (<em>p<sub>d</sub></em> is defined as 
          (<em>p<sub>2AFC</sub></em> &minus; <em>p<sub>g</sub></em>)/(1
          &minus; <em>p<sub>g</sub></em>), where <em>p<sub>g</sub></em> is
          the percent correct from guessing, or 0.50 in this case.) </p>

        <p> In <a href="#Worksheet1">Worksheet 1</a> there is also an option 
          to simulate a 2-AFC test. You can specify the number of tests in 
          this simulation and the simulation delay. The delay specifies how 
          long the result of one test is displayed on the worksheet. When you
          start the simulation, the specified number of tests will
          begin. In each test, two points will be chosen, one from
          stimulus <b>A</b> and one from <b>B</b>. The points, or
          values of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> in perceptual units, will be
          chosen with a probability specified by the displayed normal
          distribution. Most of the time, the selected point will be
          fairly close to the mean of that stimulus, but sometimes a
          point will be far from its mean. The point for <b>A</b> will
          be displayed with a blue square, and the point for <b>B</b>
          will be displayed with a green circle. The simulation's test
          subject is then asked to choose which stimulus is greater in
          perceptual units, and this (virtual) subject responds
          according to the <em>perceived</em> magnitude of the stimuli.
          If the perception of <b>B</b> is greater than that of <b>A</b>
          and therefore the subject responds correctly, then the shapes
          are filled in with that stimulus' color. If the perception of
          <b>B</b> is less than that of <b>A</b> and the subject
          responds incorrectly, then the shapes are filled in with red.
          You can pause the simulation by clicking the "PAUSE" button,
          and resume it using the "CONT." ("continue") button. A tally
          is kept of what percent of the time a response is correct or
          incorrect. </p>

        <p> The probability of correctly identifying <b>A</b> from <b>B</b>,
          <em>p<sub>2AFC</sub></em>, will also be called the "model
          correct" or "theoretical correct" value. For the 2-AFC task,
          the formula can be found in a 
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sensR/vignettes/methodology.pdf">paper by R. H. B. Christensen, Equation 6</a>. 
          As the number of simulation tests increases (e.g. from 10 to 100 
          to 1000), the percent correct from the simulation becomes closer 
          to the model-correct value. </p>

        <h2 id="Section4">4. Perceptual Testing</h2>
        <p> Having established a (hidden) model for the perception of physical
          stimuli and introduced the concept of <em>d'</em>, we'll now discuss
          perceptual testing. In perceptual testing, we ask test subjects
          questions about samples of the stimuli. The test is designed in
          such a way that we hope to (a) estimate <em>d'</em> and/or (b)
          determine if the stimuli are (probably) perceptually different.
          The number of test subjects in one trial (or test) is called 
          <em>N</em>.</p>

        <p> This tutorial describes the case where each test sample is
          presented to a different test subject, which is called a 
          "<a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/between-subjects-design">between-subjects</a>"
          design. It is also possible to present each test sample to the
          same subject, which is called a 
          "<a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/within-subjects-design">within-subjects</a>"
          design. A within-subjects design can have lower perceptual
          variation (<em>&sigma;</em> in <a href="#Section3">Section 3</a>) 
          and therefore a larger value of <em>d'</em>, but the results will 
          only be valid for that one person. In the case of a test of 
          bitterness, for example, one-third of the population might be 
          "super tasters" and have a very large <em>d'</em>, one-third might 
          be "average tasters" and have a <em>d'</em> right around 1.0,
          and one-third might be "non-tasters" and have a <em>d'</em>
          close to zero. A test of this combined population might then
          have a <em>d'</em> below 1.0. Knowing (or estimating) this
          variation in the population may assist in coming to the
          correct conclusion for a test. </p>

        <p> The focus here is on two types of tests, the <b>triangle
          test</b> and the <b>three-alternative forced-choice (3-AFC)
          test</b>. The triangle test is commonly used when you have
          an unknown difference between the stimuli, as described in
          <a href="#Section2">Section 2</a>. The 3-AFC test is commonly used 
          when you have a known difference and the test subjects can rate 
          the stimuli along that known dimension (e.g. sweetness). There are 
          a number of other types of perceptual tests not discussed here,
          including 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_testing">duo-trio, paired comparison, ABX, two-out-of-five, and same-different</a>.
        </p>

        <p> <a href="#Worksheet2">Worksheet 2</a> (below) shows the same 
          probabilities of perceptual units from the two stimuli <b>A</b> 
          and <b>B</b> (as in <a href="#Worksheet1">Worksheet 1</a>), but it 
          allows the selection of either a triangle test or a 3-AFC perceptual 
          test. </p>

        <p> In a 3-AFC test, each subject is given two samples of <b>A</b>
          and one sample of <b>B</b>, and is 
          <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~ld208/jmp12.pdf">asked to
          pick the one with the largest value of an attribute</a>
          (e.g. the highest level of sweetness). Because <b>B</b> is
          known to have the largest value of this attribute, the subject
          is effectively asked to pick stimulus <b>B</b> from the three
          choices. This comparison is performed by <em>N</em> subjects,
          yielding <em>N</em> correct or incorrect responses per test.
          Note that in order to perform this test, the experimenter must
          know that <b>B</b> has more of the attribute than <b>A</b>,
          making it a "known differences" test. </p>

        <p> In a triangle test, three samples are selected for each
          subject from the two possibilities of <b>A</b> or <b>B</b>.
          Half of the time there should be two samples of <b>A</b> and
          one of <b>B</b>, and the other half of the time these
          conditions should be reversed. Each subject is asked to select
          the one stimulus that is most different from the other two. In
          our perceptual model, that means comparing the perceptual
          distance between each pair of samples and choosing the sample
          with the largest distance from the other two. This test can be
          performed whether or not the differences between <b>A</b> and
          <b>B</b> are known to the experimenter. </p>

        <p> Note that in both types of tests, a subject can guess and
          still be correct one out of three times. Therefore, with a
          large enough number of subjects, if <em>d'</em> equals zero
          then the performance on either of these tests will be 33%. (It
          is important to control the tests so that the subjects can't
          use other information to guide their decision. For example, if
          you're testing two types of cookies for perceived sweetness,
          you don't want one cookie to have sugar crystals on top and
          the other to be plain.) </p>

        <p> <a href="#Worksheet2">Worksheet 2</a> shows, on the right-hand 
          side, the percent correct that would be obtained from the specified 
          test given the <em>d'</em> from <a href="#Worksheet1">Worksheet 1</a>
          and a large enough (or infinite) number of subjects. Again, this 
          is called the "model correct" value. The formulas for the 
          model-correct value from the 3-AFC and triangle test can be found 
          in the 
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sensR/vignettes/methodology.pdf">paper by Christensen in Equations 5 and 7, respectively</a>. 
          It can be seen that for any non-zero value of <em>d'</em> the
          3-AFC test has a larger model-correct value than the triangle
          test, until both tests reach 100% accuracy. This is because of
          the perceptual overlap between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>; the
          one sample that is different is more likely to be an extreme
          value than it is to be the sample with the largest distance to
          the other two. (H. S. Lee and M. O'Mahony have a 
          <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285865885_Sensory_difference_testing_Thurstonian_models">more detailed and better explanation 
          of the differences between these tests</a>.)</p>

        <p> In <a href="#Worksheet2">Worksheet 2</a>, just below the test 
          type, you can enter the number of subjects for a simulation, as 
          well as the simulation delay. As with 
          <a href="#Worksheet1">Worksheet 1</a>, when you start the 
          simulation one test is performed for each subject. The three test 
          samples are selected from the two stimuli according to the specified
          probability distributions. For each subject's test, the three
          samples are plotted with a blue square for <b>A</b> and a
          green circle for <b>B</b>. The three stimuli are then
          classified according to the criteria of the test (largest
          distance or maximum value). If the classification is correct,
          the shapes are filled in with that stimulus' color. If the
          classification is incorrect, the shapes are filled in with
          red. A tally is kept of what percent of the time a response is
          correct or incorrect. The result of this simulated perceptual
          test is reported as the "simulation correct" number at the
          bottom right of <a href="#Worksheet2">Worksheet 2</a>. As the 
          number of subjects increases, the simulation-correct value 
          approaches that of the model-correct value. </p>

        <p> This may be stating the obvious, but note that as the number
          of subjects increases, the variation of the perceptual stimuli
          in <a href="#Worksheet2">Worksheet 2</a> doesn't change. The 
          perceptual variation is the same, and <em>d'</em> is the same, 
          regardless of the number of subjects in the test. </p>

      <br>

      <div class="TEXT">
        <h2 id="Section5">5. Multiple Trials</h2>
        <p> We are generally concerned with a single trial of a perceptual
          test that has <em>N</em> subjects. We (a) prepare by
          determining the type of test, number of subjects, etc., (b)
          conduct the individual tests on each subject, and (c) analyze
          and interpret the result from this single trial. Once that's
          done, we have a result and move on to other things. In order to
          better understand the concepts behind significance testing and
          how to interpret the result of a trial, it can be helpful to
          think about running lots of trials. Because we're doing computer
          simulation, we can easily simulate and visualize many trials,
          running the same perceptual test over and over on a different
          set of <em>N</em> subjects each time.</p>

        <p> The perceptual test of one subject yields a binary outcome:
          a correct or incorrect response. Each test of <em>N</em>
          subjects yields some number of correct responses, <em>C</em>.
          The result of one trial can be seen as either this value <em>C</em>
          or the proportion of correct responses, <em>p<sub>trial</sub></em>
          (where <em>p<sub>trial</sub></em> = <em>C</em>/<em>N</em>).
          A series of <em>T</em> trials results in <i>T</i> values of
          <em>C</em> or <em>p<sub>trial</sub></em>. We'll call the
          average of all <em>p<sub>trial</sub></em> values from
          the <i>T</i> trials <em>p<sub>avg</sub></em>. </p>

        <p> If we divide the model-correct value from 
          <a href="#Worksheet2">Worksheet 2</a> (above) by 100, we convert 
          that from a percent to the probability of getting a correct
          response. We'll call this probability from the model <em>p</em>. 
          It can be seen in <a href="#Worksheet2">Worksheet 2</a> that as 
          the number of subjects <em>N</em> increases, the simulation results 
          become closer to the model-correct value. Regardless of the number 
          of subjects per trial, if we have a large enough number of trials, 
          we expect that the average proportion of correct responses 
          (<em>p<sub>avg</sub></em>) will approach the probability of a 
          correct response <em>p</em>.  In other words, we can reach the 
          model's probability estimate <em>p</em> by either running a single 
          experiment with a very large number of subjects, or a large number 
          of trials with a smaller number of subjects each. (The trials are 
          independent of each other, so we can think of one large trial 
          <em>T<sub>L</sub></em> with <em>N<sub>L</sub></em> subjects as 
          equivalent to two smaller trials, <em>T<sub>1</sub></em> 
          (with <em>N<sub>1</sub></em> subjects) and <em>T<sub>2</sub></em> 
          (with <em>N<sub>2</sub></em> subjects), where 
          <em>N<sub>L</sub></em> = <em>N<sub>1</sub></em> + 
          <em>N<sub>2</sub></em>.) The value of <em>p<sub>avg</sub></em>
          over a very large number of trials should be close to <em>p</em>,
          no matter what the value of <em>N</em> is. </p>

        <p> The values of <em>p<sub>trial</sub></em> will be clustered
          around an average value (<em>p<sub>avg</sub></em>) with some
          amount of variation. The more subjects there are in a trial,
          the closer each value of <em>p<sub>trial</sub></em> will be
          to <em>p</em>, and so the less variation there will be in
          these values. The fewer subjects per trial, the more that
          perceptual variation (<a href="#Section3">Section 3</a>) will 
          affect the results, and the larger the variation in results will 
          be. This difference in the variation in results with the number 
          of subjects in a trial is an important concept in the following 
          worksheets: the larger the value of <em>N</em> in our experiment, 
          the more confidence we can have in the result. To put it another 
          way, as <em>N</em> increases, there is a lower probability of a
          different trial having a different result. </p>

        <p> A trial that has a probability of <em>p</em> correct
          responses from <em>N</em> subjects can be described using a 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a>. 
          A binomial distribution is a function,
          Binomial(<em>x</em>; <em>N</em>, <em>p</em>), which returns
          the probability of seeing exactly <em>x</em> correct values
          from the <em>N</em> subjects, with each test having a
          probability of success <em>p</em>. If we iterate <em>x</em>
          from 0 to <em>N</em>, we get a set of probability values that
          sum to 1 (because a trial always generates a result). If the
          binomial distribution says that we expect 6 out of 10 subjects
          to get the correct result with probability 0.24 when <em>p</em>
          equals 0.634 (i.e. Binomial(6; 10, 0.634) = 0.24), then out of
          100 trials we expect that on average there will be 24 trials
          with exactly 6 out of 10 correct responses. The 
          "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected</a>"
          or most likely value from a binomial distribution is with <em>x</em>
          equal to <em>N</em> &times; <em>p</em>. (Although the values of <em>x</em>
          used by the binomial function are integers, this expected
          value doesn't have to be an integer, just as the average
          population of a household can be 2.5 people instead of an
          integer 2 or 3.) </p>

        <p> I'd like to get into a little math for those who are
          interested; if you're not interested in the math, you can skip
          this paragraph. The variance of a binomial distribution
          is <em>N</em> &times; <em>p</em> &times; (1 &minus; <em>p</em>), and so the
          variance increases proportionally with the number of subjects,
          <em>N</em>. The standard deviation, <em>&sigma;</em>, is the square
          root of the variance. Therefore, the standard deviation of
          probabilities from a binomial distribution also increases with
          the number of subjects, but not as quickly as the variance. If
          one looks not at the <em>number</em> of correct values from a
          trial (<em>x</em>) but at the <em>proportion</em> or 
          <em>probability</em> of correct results (i.e. the number of correct 
          values divided by the total number of subjects, 
          <em>p<sub>bin</sub></em> = <em>x</em> / <em>N</em>), then the 
          most likely value is simply <em>p</em> (instead of <em>N</em> &times;
          <em>p</em>). The standard deviation of <em>p<sub>bin</sub></em> 
          can be written as <em>&sigma;<sub>p</sub></em> = (<em>N</em> &times; 
          <em>p</em> &times; (1 &minus; <em>p</em>))<sup>1/2</sup> / 
          <em>N</em>, which is equivalent to 
          (<em>p</em> &times; (1 &minus; <em>p</em>))<sup>1/2</sup> /
          <em>N</em><sup>1/2</sup>. Therefore, as <em>N</em> increases,
          the standard deviation of the probability of a correct
          result decreases. (For example, if <em>N</em> is 4 and the
          standard deviation of the probability is 0.3, then if <em>N</em>
          increases to 16 the standard deviation decreases to 0.15.)
          This conforms with our previous expectation that as <em>N</em>
          increases, there is a lower probability of another trial
          having a different result, but the formula describes this
          expectation in a precise way. </p>

        <p> We can plot a binomial distribution and the simulation of
          many trials using bar graphs. (See 
          <a href="#Worksheet3">Worksheet 3</a>, below, with <em>N</em>
          from <a href="#Worksheet2">Worksheet 2</a> and <em>p</em> based 
          on the "model correct" value from 
          <a href="#Worksheet2">Worksheet 2</a>.) The X axis is the number 
          of subjects in one trial with a correct result (<em>x</em> for the
          binomial distribution or <em>C</em> for the simulation). Also
          on the X axis we can show the probability of a correct result
          (<em>p<sub>bin</sub></em> for the binomial distribution) or
          the proportion of correct results (<em>p<sub>trial</sub></em>
          for the simulation). For the binomial distribution, the Y axis
          is the probability of a trial having a particular X-axis
          value. For the simulation, the Y axis is the relative
          frequency of values of <em>C</em> or <em>p<sub>trial</sub></em>.
          In other words, the Y axis is the probability or relative
          frequency of exactly <em>x</em> or <em>C</em> subjects
          having a correct result. </p>

        <p> We can simulate many trials and see how the values of <em>C</em>
          cluster around a central value (<em>p<sub>avg</sub></em>). The
          result of each trial is plotted in 
          <a href="#Worksheet3">Worksheet 3</a> in blue with cross-hatched 
          lines. As the number of trials increases, <em>p<sub>avg</sub></em>
          approaches <em>p</em> from the binomial distribution. Because
          the binomial distribution provides a good description of this
          type of trial, then with a large number of trials
          the relative frequency of <em>C</em> values from each trial
          should have a distribution close to that of the probabilities
          from a binomial distribution. </p>

        <p> The "binomial" numbers on the right side of 
          <a href="#Worksheet3">Worksheet 3</a> show some values predicted 
          by a binomial distribution with parameters <em>N</em> and <em>p</em>.
          The first value ("expect") is the number of subjects we expect 
          to provide a correct response, on average. This value is 
          <em>N</em> &times; <em>p</em>.  The second value ("<em>p</em>") 
          is the probability of a correct response, which is the percent 
          correct predicted by the model in 
          <a href="#Worksheet2">Worksheet 2</a> divided by 100. The third 
          value ("<em>&sigma;<sub>p</sub></em>") is the standard deviation 
          of values of <em>p<sub>bin</sub></em>. </p>

        <p> The "simulation" numbers on the right side of 
          <a href="#Worksheet3">Worksheet 3</a> show the values obtained 
          from the simulation of <em>T</em> trials. The first value 
          ("avg. corr.") is the number of subjects who get a correct result, 
          on average. The second value ("<em>p<sub>avg</sub></em>") is the 
          average proportion of correct responses (i.e. the average number 
          of subjects with a correct response divided by the number of 
          subjects per trial). The third value ("<em>s</em>") is the standard
          deviation of the values of <em>p<sub>trial</sub></em>. As the
          number of trials increases, the values from this simulation
          become closer to the values predicted by the binomial
          distribution. </p>

        <h2 id="Section6">6. Significance Testing: H0</h2>
        <p> Referring back to <a href="#Section2">Section 2</a> for a moment, 
          recall that our goal is to determine whether the two stimuli are 
          perceptually different or not. The easiest way to show that they are
          different, mathematically, is to show that they are not the
          same. Why is it easier? Because a hypothesis that the stimuli
          are perceptually the same (which we hope to disprove) requires
          no knowledge about all the ways in which they might be
          different. We'll call this hypothesis H0, or the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusion_of_the_null_hypothesis">null hypothesis</a>. 
          For H0, we only need to know the number of subjects in order to 
          create a binomial distribution; the probability of a correct 
          response is the same as random guessing, or 0.333. We don't need 
          to figure out (or estimate) <em>d'</em>; under this hypothesis, 
          <em>d'</em> is zero.</p>

        <p> A hypothesis like H0 is tested in terms of probabilities. We
          perform one trial of an experiment and measure some result, 
          <em>C</em>.  We can then find the probability of observing this 
          result using the binomial distribution under the assumption that 
          this hypothesis is true, i.e. 
          Binomial(<em>C</em>; <em>N</em>, <em>p</em>).
          For H0, this becomes Binomial(<em>C</em>; <em>N</em>, 0.333).
          (We can express this probability in mathematical notation as 
          <em>p</em>(<em>X</em>=<em>C</em> | H0), or the probability of 
          a result <em>X</em> being equal to the observed value <em>C</em>, 
          given H0). We want to know the probability of observing 
          <em>at least</em> this result, in other words a value of 
          <em>C</em> or larger (i.e. 
          <em>p</em>(<em>X</em>&ge;<em>C</em> | H0)), and so we compute 
          probabilities from the binomial distribution for all values from 
          <em>C</em> to <em>N</em> and sum them up. This is called the 
          "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"><em>p</em> value</a>"
          of the experiment. If this <em>p</em> value, or the probability 
          of getting a result of at least <em>C</em> when H0 is true, is 
          less than some threshold, then we conclude that this result is 
          sufficiently improbable given the assumption that H0 is true, 
          and therefore we reject H0. If we reject H0 (in which <em>d'</em> 
          equals 0), then we accept the hypothesis that <em>d'</em> is 
          not zero, and we therefore conclude that there is a perceptual 
          difference. A test that rejects H0 is said to have demonstrated 
          significance. This type of hypothesis testing is referred to as 
          "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5635437/">null
          hypothesis significance testing</a>", or NHST.</p>

        <p> One complication with NHST is that if we don't reject H0, then
          we can't say anything at all about the two stimuli. Not
          rejecting H0 doesn't lead us to accept H0; it simply leaves us
          with no conclusion (<em>d'</em> may or may not be zero). The
          higher the bar for disproving H0, the more likely it is that
          we won't be able to conclude anything at all about an
          experimental result. </p>

        <p> The way that we've defined H0 above (that the two stimuli
          are the same, or that <em>d'</em> equals zero) is kind of a
          classic, tried-and-true null hypothesis that is very commonly
          used. However, we don't <em>need</em> to define H0 as the
          case in which the stimuli are the same. In 
          <a href="#Section9">Section 9</a> we will consider a different 
          definition of H0. For now, though, we'll stick with the classics. 

        <p> The threshold for rejecting H0 is called <em>alpha</em>, 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance">the
            probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it
            was assumed to be true</a>. I'll use the subscript H0 to be
          clear that this is the threshold for rejecting H0, i.e. 
          <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>.  A commonly used value for 
          <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em> is 0.05, meaning that H0 will be 
          (incorrectly) rejected 5% of the time when H0 is true. (The value 
          of 0.05 is common but other values can be used, depending on the 
          purpose of the test.) Note that (by definition) when 
          <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em> is 0.05, in 1 out of every 20 experiments
          in which H0 <em>is</em> true, we will incorrectly conclude that 
          there is a perceptual difference between the stimuli. </p>
          
        <p> By the way, I try to avoid phrases such as "the effect is
          significant" because the result of a significance test depends
          on the combination of the hypothesis, the data, and how the
          test was conducted. Significance testing does not provide an
          objective truth or even a claim about the hypothesis, but a
          claim about the outcome of a testing process. Changing the
          process can change whether the result is significant or not,
          even with the same hypothesis. If a test demonstrates
          significance, that doesn't prove anything about the
          hypothesis; in fact, with the standard <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>
          at 0.05, H0 will be incorrectly rejected on average 5% of the
          time. With a larger number of subjects it becomes easier to
          reject the null hypothesis, to the point that there may be no
          <em>practical</em> difference between the perception of the
          two stimuli, but we may still reject H0 (e.g. when <i>d'</i>
          is 0.05). Therefore, I prefer to say that a test "demonstrates
          significance". What significance implies about the perception
          of the two stimuli needs to be evaluated within the context of
          the test. </p>

        <p> <a href="#Worksheet4">Worksheet 4</a> (below) shows the binomial 
          distribution for H0 with <em>d'</em>=0. No matter how many subjects 
          there are, the probability of <em>X</em> subjects having a correct
          result is maximum when <em>X</em> is one-third of <em>N</em>,
          or when the probability of any one subject having a correct
          result is 0.333. This reflects the fact that the most likely
          result of randomly guessing one of three options is to be
          right one-third of the time. (Although it is still quite
          possible to guess the correct answer more or less of the time,
          it is not as likely.) As the number of subjects increases, the
          relative variation in this distribution decreases. Therefore,
          with a larger number of subjects, it is more likely that the
          result will be close to one-third of <em>N</em>. </p>

        <p> You can specify the value of <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em> in
          this worksheet. The value of <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>
          determines the threshold for the number of subjects that must
          have a correct result in order to reject H0. If the number of
          subjects with a correct result is less than this threshold,
          the probability of this result (given H0) is shown in light
          red. If the number of subjects with a correct result is
          greater than or equal to this threshold, the probability is
          shown in dark red. The sum of all of the dark-red
          probabilities is, by definition, less than or equal to 
          <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>.  If you get a result anywhere in the 
          dark-red region, H0 can be rejected. The light-red probabilities 
          are therefore labeled "H0 inconclusive", and the dark-red 
          probabilities are labeled "H0 reject". An orange vertical dashed 
          line shows the boundary between inconclusive H0 and rejecting H0. 
          Just above this line the symbol <em>&alpha;<sub>H0</sub></em> 
          indicates that this is the <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em> threshold 
          for rejection. </p>

        <p> Note that the region in dark red is only for the higher
          number of correct responses in the binomial probability
          distribution. Rejecting H0 only when the result is in the high
          end of the probability distribution is called a one-tailed
          test. In some cases, it's important to have the region of
          rejection at both ends of the probability distribution, which
          is called a two-tailed test. Whether one should use a
          one-tailed or two-tailed test depends on what the null
          hypothesis is and what it means to get a test result at either
          end of the probability distribution. </p>

        <p> For perceptual testing, we interpret a result at the high
          end of the probability distribution to mean that <em>d'</em>
          is unlikely to be zero. But what does a result at the low end
          of the probability distribution mean? If our two stimuli <b>A</b>
          and <b>B</b> are assumed to be equal and we conduct a
          triangle or 3-AFC test with 60 subjects, we expect 20 subjects
          to guess the correct result, on average. With 
          <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em> at 0.05, if 27 subjects get the 
          correct result, we conclude that probably the stimuli aren't 
          really equal after all, and we reject H0. On the flip side, let's 
          say that only 13 subjects get the correct result, which should 
          happen about 2% of the time if our model is a good description of 
          our experiment. If I got such a result, I would suspect that there
          might be something wrong in the experimental setup, and I
          would spend time verifying that there were no mistakes in how
          the experiment was conducted. The smaller the number of
          correct responses, the more time I would spend trying to find
          an error. If I had zero correct responses out of 60, I would
          spend a very long time seeing if anything had gone wrong in
          the way the experiment was conducted. If I found an error, I
          would fix it and re-run the experiment; if I found no error, I
          would accept the result and not reject H0. In this case, the purpose 
          of analyzing a result at the lower end of the distribution is not
          to reject H0, but to verify that the test was properly
          conducted. I would like to call this region at the low end of
          the binomial probability distribution the "region of likely
          experimental error", and notate it as <em>R<sub>L(EE)</sub></em>.
          This region is shown on the top left of 
          <a href="#Worksheet4">Worksheet 4</a> with a horizontal orange 
          line and arrows pointing to the beginning and end of this region.</p>

        <p> On the right-hand side of <a href="#Worksheet4">Worksheet 4</a>, 
          under "<b>H0:</b>", there are five values. The first ("expect") is 
          the expected number of subjects who will get a correct result (on 
          average), the second (<em>p<sub>H0</sub></em>) is the probability 
          of any one subject getting a correct result (which is always 0.333),
          and the third value (<em>&sigma;<sub>H0</sub></em>) is the standard
          deviation of this binomial probability distribution. The next
          number ("<em>thresh<sub>H0</sub></em>") is the threshold for
          rejecting H0, expressed as the number of subjects. If a trial
          has <em>C</em> subjects with a correct result, and if <em>C</em>
          is greater than or equal to <em>thresh<sub>H0</sub></em>,
          then H0 is rejected. The final number ("<em>p<sub>RejH0</sub></em>")
          is the probability of rejecting H0 using this threshold. In
          theory (or with a large enough number of subjects), 
          <em>p<sub>RejH0</sub></em> is equal to <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>, 
          but with a small number of subjects, this number may be noticeably 
          less than <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>.  If the threshold were 
          lowered by a single subject, though, this probability would become 
          greater than <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>.</p>

        <p> When you start the simulation with the specified number of
          trials, each trial will be conducted (as in 
          <a href="#Worksheet2">Worksheet 2</a>) with the specified number 
          of subjects and <em>d'</em> equal to zero. The result of each 
          trial is plotted in <a href="#Worksheet4">Worksheet 4</a> in
          blue with striped lines. On the right-hand side of 
          <a href="#Worksheet4">Worksheet 4</a>, under 
          "<b>H0 simulation:</b>", there are four numbers. The
          first ("avg. corr.") is the average number of correct
          responses in this simulation, the second 
          ("<em>p<sub>avgH0</sub></em>") is the average proportion of 
          correct responses (i.e. the average number of correct responses 
          divided by <em>N</em>) given H0, and the third number 
          ("<em>s<sub>H0</sub></em>") is the standard deviation of the 
          results from these simulated trials. The fourth number, on 
          the bottom, ("reject") shows how often the null hypothesis was 
          rejected even when it was true.  With a large enough number of 
          trials, "avg. corr." should be close to "expect", 
          <em>p<sub>avgH0</sub></em> should be close to 
          <em>p<sub>H0</sub></em>, <em>s<sub>H0</sub></em> should
          be close to <em>&sigma;<sub>H0</sub></em>, and "reject", when
          divided by 100, should be close to <em>p<sub>RejH0</sub></em>.

      <div class="TEXT">
        <h2 id="Section7">7. Significance Testing: H0 and H1</h2>
        <p> Using the null hypothesis, H0, we can easily evaluate if a test
          result <em>C</em> is so large that it's very improbable that
          the two stimuli are perceptually the same. If we consider an
          alternate hypothesis, called H1, we can obtain an estimate of
          how much risk we take by doing the test as planned. We know
          (from <a href="#Section6">Section 6</a>) that if H0 can not be 
          rejected based on some result, then we can come to no conclusion 
          about the hypothesis (we can neither accept nor reject H0). Having 
          H1 lets us potentially avoid spending a huge effort only to shrug 
          and say "we don't know". With H1, we can design the test so that 
          it is more likely to demonstrate a significant result.</p>

        <p> H1 is a different hypothesis about the value of <em>d'</em>.
          What should this value be? This is a bit of a 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_(logic)">catch-22</a>.
          Ideally, it is the best estimate we already have for <em>d'</em>,
          based on 
          <a href="https://research.usu.edu//irb/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/08/A_Researchers_Guide_to_Power_Analysis_USU.pdf">pilot data or a 
          literature search</a>. 
          This ideal isn't always practical, though.  There are many times 
          when we have no 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment">pilot
          data</a>. Using values of <em>d'</em> from similar studies
          found in the literature is one possibility, but the uncertainty 
          in our estimate will be very large even if we can find several 
          such studies. And, of course, sometimes we're performing an 
          entirely new study and there is nowhere to obtain a good 
          estimate of <em>d'</em>. </p>

        <p> Without pilot data or an estimate from the literature, a
          common option in some fields is to guess that <em>d'</em> is
          0.5, which is considered a 
          <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/effect-size.html">"medium"
          effect size</a>. 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Cohen_(statistician)">Jacob Cohen</a> 
          classified an effect size of 0.5 as medium 
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3444174/">because such an effect is "visible to the naked eye of a careful observer"</a>, 
          but he noted that his suggested categorizations should be flexible 
          and he 
          "<a href="https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1536&amp;context=jmasm">warned about ... them becoming de facto standards 
          for research</a>".  Instead, his 
          "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3444174/">ballpark categories 
          provide a general guide that should also be informed by context</a>".
          For perceptual testing, a <em>d'</em> of 0.5 means a probability 
          of discrimination (<em>p<sub>d</sub></em>, defined in 
          <a href="#Section3">Section 3</a>) of only 28%, which seems 
          like a very small perceptual difference between two stimuli. 
          Instead, I will use a <em>d'</em> of 1.0, or approximately the
          just-noticeable difference (JND) with a probability of
          discrimination of 50% (<a href="#Section3">Section 3</a>). 
          (Of course, if you think that the JND is too strict or too lenient,
          feel free to choose a different value for <em>d'</em>.) </p>

        <p> If you have some other estimate of (or preference for) <em>d'</em>,
          please go ahead and use it. For the rest of this tutorial,
          though, I'll define H1 as the hypothesis that <em>d'</em> is
          1.0, approximately the JND. This hypothesis is interesting
          because it's right at the threshold of where we consider the
          two stimuli to be consistently perceived as the same or
          different. </p>

        <p> Once we have H1, we can estimate not only the probability of
          rejecting H0 when it is true (<em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>), we
          can also estimate the probability of an inconclusive result
          when H1 is true, called 
          <a href="https://ncu.libguides.com/statsresources/alphabeta"><em>beta</em></a>.
          I will refer to it as <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em> to emphasize
          that this probability is conditioned on H1 being true. It is
          common to target a <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em> value of 0.20,
          meaning that if H1 is true we will have an inconclusive result
          (on average) 20% of the time. The 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test">power</a>
          of a test is defined as 1 &minus; <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em>, and
          so a test with high power has a low probability of being
          inconclusive. </p>

        <p> <em>Beta<sub>H1</sub></em> is the area under the binomial
          distribution of H1 for all subjects with a correct response up
          to (but not including) the threshold for <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>.
          Once we have the binomial distribution for H1, beta can be
          computed by iterating over all number of correct responses
          from 0 up to (but not including) the value of 
          <em>thresh<sub>H0</sub></em> defined in 
          <a href="#Section6">Section 6</a> and 
          <a href="#Worksheet4">Worksheet 4</a>. (Visually, this limit is
          indicated with the dashed orange line marked 
          <em>&alpha;<sub>H0</sub></em> in 
          <a href="#Worksheet5">Worksheet 5</a>.) All of the probabilities 
          from the binomial distribution in this range are summed up to a 
          total probability, which is <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em>. </p>

        <p> Once we've decided on the type of test, number of subjects,
          H0, H1, and <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>, we can compute the
          value of <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em>. If we're not happy with
          this value of <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em> (because it will
          lead to too many tests being inconclusive), then we need to
          change some of the parameters (e.g. <em>N</em>) or
          assumptions (e.g. H1) of the test. If we make the assumptions
          more lenient in order to increase the estimated power of the
          test, we run more of a risk of failing to demonstrate a
          significant result when one does exist. Therefore, we usually
          increase <em>N</em> until we reach the desired value of 
          <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em>. </p>

        <p> Having H1 and knowing <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em> doesn't
          change the threshold for rejecting H0, and nothing we do
          allows us to accept H0 or H1. In that sense, H1 is not
          necessary for significance testing. However, it can be very
          useful to have in advance some idea of the likelihood of being
          able to demonstrate significance (if a difference does exist).  </p>

        <p> <a href="#Worksheet5">Worksheet 5</a> shows two binomial 
          distributions, one for H0 (in light red) and one for H1 (in 
          light green). The hypothesis H1 in this worksheet is that 
          <em>d'</em> is the value specified in 
          <a href="#Worksheet1">Worksheet 1</a> (not necessarily 1.0). 
          Where the two distributions overlap, the color is a dark (or 
          olive) green.  This worksheet is largely the same as 
          <a href="#Worksheet4">Worksheet 4</a>, but with the addition of 
          H1. The standard deviation shown in this worksheet is for H1 
          instead of H0. </p>

        <p> In the top-left corner of this worksheet, the values of 
          <em>d'</em> (for H1), the type of test, number of subjects, 
          <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>, <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em>, and 
          the power are specified. Below this, you can enter the number 
          of trials and delay for a simulation. In this case, the 
          simulation will generate and score data for H1. Each trial is 
          plotted in black with cross-hatched lines. </p>

        <p> On the right-hand side of <a href="#Worksheet5">Worksheet 5</a>, 
          under "<b>H0:</b>", there are three values. The first 
          ("<em>p<sub>H0</sub></em>") is the probability of any one 
          subject getting a correct result (always 0.333), the second 
          ("<em>thresh<sub>H0</sub></em>") is the threshold for rejecting 
          H0 (expressed as the number of subjects), and the third 
          ("<em>p<sub>RejH0</sub></em>") is the probability of rejecting 
          H0 using this threshold. </p>

        <p> On the right-hand side of <a href="#Worksheet5">Worksheet 5</a>, 
          under "<b>H1:</b>", there are four values. The first ("expect") 
          is the expected number of subjects who will get a correct result 
          (on average) when H1 is true. The second ("<em>p<sub>H1</sub></em>")
          is the probability of any one subject getting a correct result. The
          third ("<em>&sigma;<sub>H1</sub></em>") is the standard deviation of
          the probability distribution of H1. The fourth 
          ("<em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em>") is the computed value of beta, 
          or the probability of an inconclusive result. (This value of beta 
          is the same as on the left-hand side of the worksheet.) </p>

        <p> On the right-hand side of <a href="#Worksheet5">Worksheet 5</a>, 
          under "<b>H1 simluation:</b>", there are four values. The first 
          ("avg.  corr.") is the average number of correct responses in this
          simulation of H1, the second ("<em>p<sub>avgH1</sub></em>") is
          the average proportion of correct responses (i.e. the average
          number of correct responses divided by <em>N</em>) given H1,
          and the third number ("<em>s<sub>H1</sub></em>") is the
          standard deviation of the results from these simulated trials.
          The fourth number, on the bottom ("incn."), shows the percent
          of trials that yielded an inconclusive result (i.e. not
          rejecting H0). With a large enough number of trials, "avg.
          corr." should be close to "expect", <em>p<sub>avgH1</sub></em>
          should be close to <em>p<sub>H1</sub></em>, <em>s<sub>H1</sub></em>
          should be close to <em>&sigma;<sub>H1</sub></em>, and "incn.", when
          divided by 100, should be close to <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em>. </p>

        <h2 id="Section8">8. Interpreting a Result That Doesn't Demonstrate
          Significance</h2>
          <p> By design, statistical significance is a reasonably high bar to
          meet. In research areas such as clinical trials, where lives may
          be at stake, it can be prudent to focus only on those results
          that demonstrate significance. In perceptual testing, however,
          or when running a pilot study, we may want to get as much
          information as we can from our test, regardless of whether or
          not the results demonstrate significance. For example, it might
          not be possible to get the 209 subjects needed to conduct a
          triangle test with <em>d'</em> = 1.0, <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>
          = 0.05, and <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em> = 0.20. Sometimes even
          getting 10 subjects, or one subject to perform 10 tests, can be
          a logistical challenge. Without lives at stake, the answer to
          our question "are the two stimuli perceptually different" may
          not require demonstrating statistical significance. What happens
          when we conduct a test and the results don't demonstrate
          significance? Rather than give up entirely, we can use the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test">likelihood
          ratio</a> to interpret our result. The likelihood ratio tells
          us how likely one hypothesis is over the other, given the
          result. There is no threshold for acceptance, but the higher the
          ratio, the more compelling the result is. </p>

        <p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function">likelihood</a>
          of a hypothesis given a result is defined as the probability
          of the result given the hypothesis. In mathematical notation,
          <em>L</em>(<em>H</em> | <em>C</em>) = <em>p</em>(<em>C</em> | 
          <em>H</em>). The likelihood function, <em>L</em>, 
          "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function">measures
          the goodness of fit of a statistical model to a sample of
          data</a>". When talking about probabilities, the hypothesis
          is fixed (or given) and we evaluate the possible outcomes.
          With likelihoods, the outcome is fixed (e.g. 13 correct
          responses out of 20) and we evaluate the possible parameter(s)
          of the model, which in our case is the value of <em>d'</em>. </p>

        <p> The <b>likelihood ratio</b> of two hypotheses estimates how
          much more likely one hypothesis is compared with the other. A
          likelihood ratio of 1.0 indicates that both hypotheses are
          equally likely. The likelihood ratio of H1 to H0 is the
          likelihood of H1 divided by the likelihood of H0, or <em>L</em>(H1
          | <em>C</em>) / <em>L</em>(H0 | <em>C</em>). (For those of
          you who are into 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics">Bayesian
          statistics</a>, the likelihood ratio is the same as the 
          <a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2006.00204.x">Bayes factor</a> 
          when constraining the Bayes factor hypotheses to single outcomes.) 
          If <em>L</em>(H1 | <em>C</em>) is 0.132 and <em>L</em>(H0 | 
          <em>C</em>) is 0.025, then we can say that H1 is 5.3 times more 
          likely than H0 given the test result <em>C</em>. </p>

        <p> We are using <em>d'</em>=0 for H0 and <em>d'</em>=1 for
          H1. Is the true value of <em>d'</em> in our test going to be
          exactly 0.0 or exactly 1.0? Probably not. But the likelihood
          ratio of these two hypotheses tells us the relative strength
          of a just-noticeable difference to no perceptual difference,
          given the result. These are two points of interest that help
          us judge whether two stimuli are likely to be (just)
          perceptually different or not. If the likelihood ratio favors
          a <em>d'</em> of 0, then it is more likely that there is no
          difference; if it favors a <em>d'</em> of 1, then it is more
          likely that there is a perceptual difference. It would be
          interesting to consider a range of possible <em>d'</em>
          values for H1, such as <em>d'</em> &ge; 1. However, doing this
          (using the Bayes factor), requires knowing or assuming <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability">prior
            probabilities</a> that we don't really know anything about.
          To keep things simple, we can focus on two specific values of
          <em>d'</em>. </p>

        <p> In <a href="#Section6">Section 6</a>, I named the region where 
          there was a likely experimental error as <em>R<sub>L(EE)</sub></em>. 
          H1 specifies that <i>d'</i> equals some value <i>D</i> (usually
          1 in this tutorial).&nbsp; Considering the region where the
          likelihood of H0 is greater than H1, this is equivalent to
          saying that <em>d'</em>=0 is more likely than <em>d'</em>=<i>D</i>.
          I'd therefore like to call this region <em>R<sub>L(d'=0)</sub></em>,
          i.e. the region where <em>d'</em>=0 is more likely. For each
          number of correct responses, <em>C</em>, in this region, we
          can determine the likelihood ratio for H0 to H1, or how much
          more likely H0 is than H1. The region where the likelihood of
          H1 is greater than H0 can be called <em>R<sub>L(d'=D)</sub></em>,
          and for each value of <em>C</em> in this region we can
          determine how much more likely H1 is than H0. </p>

        <p> <a href="#Worksheet6">Worksheet 6</a> shows the same two binomial 
          distributions from <a href="#Worksheet5">Worksheet 5</a>, one for 
          H0 (in red) and one for H1 (in light green). In addition to 
          showing <em>R<sub>L(EE)</sub></em> with a horizontal orange line, 
          this worksheet shows the region where <em>d'</em> is more likely to 
          be zero, <em>R<sub>L(d'=0)</sub></em>, and the region where 
          <em>d'</em> is more likely to be the value specified for H1, 
          <em>R<sub>L(d'=D)</sub></em>.  Vertical dashed orange lines are 
          placed at the boundaries of these regions for greater visual 
          clarity. </p>

        <p> In the top left corner of this worksheet, the values of 
          <em>d'</em> (for H1), the type of test, number of subjects, 
          <em>alpha<sub>H0</sub></em>, <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em>, and the 
          power are specified. Below this, you can enter the number of 
          correct responses in a test, <em>C</em>. (Sorry, there are no 
          more simulations in this tutorial.) A vertical gray bar is plotted 
          at the specified value of <em>C</em>. </p>

        <p> On the right-hand side of <a href="#Worksheet6">Worksheet 6</a>, 
          under "<b>H0:</b>", there are the same three values as in 
          <a href="#Worksheet5">Worksheet 5</a>. In addition, there is 
          "<em>pval<sub>H0</sub></em>", which shows the <em>p</em> value 
          for an experiment with this value of <em>C</em>.  If this 
          <em>p</em> value is less than or equal to <em>p<sub>RejH0</sub></em>,
          then H0 can be rejected. Under "<b>H1:</b>", there are three
          of the same values from <a href="#Worksheet5">Worksheet 5</a>. 
          (The value of <em>&sigma;<sub>H1</sub></em> has been omitted 
          because it is less interesting.) </p>

        <p> Finally, on the right-hand side of 
          <a href="#Worksheet5">Worksheet 5</a>, under "<b>Likelihoods:</b>",
          there are three values. The first ("<em>L</em>(H0)") is the
          likelihood of H0 given the result <em>C</em>. The second 
          ("<em>L</em>(H1)") is the likelihood of H1 given the result 
          <em>C</em>. The third value ("LR:") specifies which hypothesis 
          is more likely and the likelihood ratio for this hypothesis against 
          the other. (Because the more likely hypothesis is specified, this
          likelihood ratio will always be greater than or equal to 1.)
          If this likelihood ratio is greater than 200, the value "200+"
          is shown for visual clarity, because 
          <a href="https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1167&amp;context=jps">anything over 150 is generally considered "decisive"</a>. 
          For example, a value such as "H1 = 18.51" says that the <em>d'</em>
          value from H1 is 18.51 times more likely than a <em>d'</em>
          value of 0. A value such as "H0 = 2.24" says that a <em>d'</em>
          value of 0 is 2.24 times more likely than the value of <em>d'</em>
          from H1. </p>

      <div class="TEXT">
        <h2 id="Section9">9. Significance Testing: Is <em>d'</em> Greater 
        Than One?</h2>
        <p> The use of the likelihood ratio in 
          <a href="#Worksheet6">Worksheet 6</a> illustrates one problem with 
          these ratios at higher correct-response rates. If, for example, 
          we have 20 subjects in a 3-AFC test when H1 is <em>d'</em>=1.0,
          and there are 19 correct responses, then the likelihood ratio is
          (correctly) very large in favor of H1. But with 19 correct
          responses, the likelihoods of both hypotheses are tiny, at
          0.000000011 for H0 and 0.0013 for H1. These tiny likelihoods
          strongly suggest that neither H0 nor H1 are true. If the true
          value of <em>d'</em> isn't even close to either hypothesis,
          then the likelihood ratio of the two hypotheses is in some sense a
          "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdirection_(magic)">misdirection</a>,"
          forcing us to look over here (at H0 and H1) when the interesting
          information is over there (a much larger <em>d'</em>).
          Fortunately, there is an easy solution to this problem that we
          have already covered: use conventional null-hypothesis
          significance testing (NHST) to reject H1 (in addition to H0) at
          the specified alpha value. In other words, treat H1 as our null
          hypothesis and see if the evidence is strong enough to reject
          it. If we can reject H1 with <em>d'</em>=1, we can conclude
          that <em>d'</em> is (probably) greater than 1. If we can
          demonstrate significance and therefore claim that there is (probably)
          more than a just-noticeable difference between the two stimuli, we
          have come to a very satisfactory conclusion.</p>

        <p> The previous paragraph implies that we could have skipped
          Sections 7 and 8 entirely, and simply used <em>d'</em>=1 as
          our null hypothesis in <a href="#Section6">Section 6</a>. 
          However, it is often difficult enough to demonstrate significance 
          for the hypothesis that <em>d'</em> is greater than zero. Presumably
          it will be a rare event when we demonstrate that <em>d'</em>
          is probably greater than 1. By keeping H0 as <em>d'</em>=0,
          H1 as <em>d'</em>=1, and using likelihood ratios, we can
          extract much more information from our result, which might be
          a large or small number of correct responses. </p>

        <p> Testing multiple hypotheses at the same time is possible,
          but it is important to understand the 
          <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mgoldman/Section0402.pdf">implications</a>.
          A common pitfall with testing multiple hypotheses is that as
          you add more and more comparisons, it becomes more and more
          likely that at least one hypothesis will demonstrate
          significance. (This effect has been nicely illustrated by 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe">Randall Munroe</a> 
          at <a href="https://xkcd.com/882/">XKCD</a>.) If the success of 
          an experiment (or a series of experiments) is dependent on
          demonstrating significance in only one case, then testing
          multiple hypotheses often makes it (artificially) easier to
          succeed. In this case, however, testing both H0 and H1 doesn't
          change the number of times we demonstrate a significant
          result, relative to testing only H0. If we reject H1 we always
          reject H0, and so rejecting H1 implies rejecting H0. If we
          come to no conclusion about H0, we also come to no conclusion
          about H1. If we reject H0 but do not reject H1, we come only
          to the conclusion that <em>d'</em> is probably greater than
          0; we have no opinion about whether <em>d'</em> is 1 or not.
          We have three possible conclusions from the combination of the
          two tests: (1) we don't reject H0 (or H1), (2) we reject H0
          and conclude that <em>d'</em> &gt; 0, or (3) we reject H1
          (and H0) and conclude that <em>d'</em> &gt; 1. The number of
          times that we demonstrate a significant result is no different
          than if we had tested only H0. The purpose of testing these
          two hypotheses is not to determine a single outcome of
          significance from two independent tests; the purpose is to
          better understand, before conducting a test, what this one
          test result will tell us about <em>d'</em>. Why not carry
          this approach to its logical extreme and test all possible
          values of <em>d'</em>, and then select the hypothesis that
          best fits the data? The first reason is that this is
          confounding a 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"><em>hypothesis</em></a>
          (which, by definition, is made before conducting a test) with
          a <em>result</em>. If we specify our hypothesis based on the
          outcome of a test, then it is a result, not a hypothesis. We
          can't do hypothesis testing without a hypothesis. The second
          (and related) reason is that if we want to estimate <em>d'</em>
          and not just test a hypothesis or two about it, then we should
          use a technique designed for that purpose, as discussed in
          <a href="#Section10">Section 10</a>.</p>

        <p> The approach of using both NHST and likelihood ratios leads
          to several classification regions in the binomial
          distribution. Where H1 is the hypothesis that <em>d'</em> is
          some value <em>D</em> (usually 1.0 in this tutorial), then
          there are four non-overlapping regions: (1) the region where
          there is likely experimental error (<em>R<sub>L(EE)</sub></em>)
          (and if there is no error, then the likelihood ratio favors 
          <em>d'</em>=0), (2) the region where it's more likely that 
          <em>d'</em> is 0 than <em>D</em> (<em>R<sub>L(d'=0)</sub></em>), 
          (3) the region where it's more likely that <em>d'</em> is 
          <em>D</em> than 0 (<em>R<sub>L(d'=D)</sub></em>), and (4) using 
          NHST to reject H1, the region where we conclude that <em>d'</em> is
          probably greater than <em>D</em> (<em>R<sub>L(d'&gt;D)</sub></em>).
          Another region has a boundary within either 
          <em>R<sub>L(d'=0)</sub></em> or <em>R<sub>L(d'=D)</sub></em>, 
          namely the region where we conclude that <em>d'</em> is probably 
          greater than 0 (from <a href="#Section6">Section 6</a>). For the 
          regions <em>R<sub>L(d'=0)</sub></em> and 
          <em>R<sub>L(d'=D)</sub></em>, the likelihood ratio can give us
          more detail about the relative strength of the two hypotheses.
          Note that if a result is in <em>R<sub>L(d'=D)</sub></em>,
          that doesn't mean that it's more likely that <em>d'</em>=<em>D</em>
          than <em>d'</em>&gt;<em>D</em>; it just means that the
          evidence isn't strong enough to reject the hypothesis that 
          <em>d'</em>=<em>D</em>. </p>

        <p> <a href="#Worksheet7">Worksheet 7</a> is very similar to 
          <a href="#Worksheet6">Worksheet 6</a>, but the region
          where it's more likely that <em>d'</em>=<em>D</em> than 0 has
          been reduced, and there is a new region where it's likely that
          <em>d'</em>&gt;<em>D</em>. The worksheet also displays
          different information about H1. In particular, the "expect"
          and <em>beta<sub>H1</sub></em> values are no longer displayed
          (for conciseness). The figure now shows (a) 
          <em>thresh<sub>H1</sub></em>, the threshold for rejecting H1 
          (expressed as the number of subjects), (b) 
          <em>p<sub>RejH1</sub></em>, the probability of incorrectly 
          rejecting H1 using this threshold when H1 is true, and (c) 
          <em>pval<sub>H1</sub></em>, the <em>p</em> value for
          an experiment with this value of <em>C</em> given H1. If this
          <em>p</em> value is less than or equal to <em>p<sub>RejH1</sub></em>,
          then H1 can be rejected and we can conclude that <em>d'</em>
          is probably greater than the value specified by H1. </p>

      <div class="TEXT">
        <h2 id="Section10">10. Estimating <em>d'</em> and Confidence Intervals</h2>
          <p> We may want to estimate <em>d'</em> from our test result, 
          <em>C</em>.  Our current experiment might be a pilot study, and 
          we want to estimate <i>d'</i> in order to use a well-motivated 
          value of <em>d'</em> when estimating the power of a subsequent 
          (and possibly larger) experiment (as discussed in 
          <a href="#Section7">Section 7</a>). Maybe we've run a trial
          with 200 subjects and we got 160 correct responses, far greater
          than we'd get with a <em>d'</em> of 1.0, and we want some
          estimate of <em>d'</em>, not just the conclusion that <em>d'</em>
          &gt; 1. Even without a large number of correct responses, after
          we come to the conclusion that <em>d'</em> probably is greater
          than zero, or that it probably isn't, or that we can't be sure
          but it's more likely than not, it's logical to then ask for our
          best estimate of <em>d'</em>, if only for curiosity's sake.</p>

        <p> The first step is to consider the binomial distribution for
          the unknown but true value of <em>d'</em> in our experiment.
          This distribution has a known number of subjects but an
          unknown probability <em>p<sub>d'</sub></em>, the probability
          of success of an experiment with the true value of <em>d'</em>.
          We have result <em>C</em> from our test, and this test has,
          according to our model, a perceptual distance with the true
          value of <em>d'</em>. We don't know if our test result is at
          the peak of this binomial distribution associated with <em>d'</em>,
          but <a href="https://stats.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Probability_Theory/Book%3A_Probability_Mathematical_Statistics_and_Stochastic_Processes_(Siegrist)/11%3A_Bernoulli_Trials/11.02%3A_The_Binomial_Distribution">the best (maximum-likelihood) estimate we have of <em>p</em> for this test is <em>C</em>/<em>N</em></a> 
          which we can call <em>p<sub>est</sub></em>. Because this test has 
          the true value of <em>d'</em>, the best estimate of 
          <em>p<sub>d'</sub></em> is the same as <em>p<sub>est</sub></em>, 
          namely <em>C</em>/<em>N</em>.  The larger the value of <em>N</em>, 
          the better we expect this estimate to be, as discussed in 
          <a href="#Section5">Section 5</a>. </p>

        <p> Given <em>N</em> and the test type, every value of <em>d'</em>
          yields a unique value of <em>p</em>. Previously we've computed 
          <em>p</em> from <em>d'</em>, <em>N</em>, and the test type 
          (Sections 3 and 4, using 
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sensR/vignettes/methodology.pdf">equations from Christensen</a>). 
          We can determine the value of <em>d'</em> that corresponds with 
          <em>p<sub>est</sub></em> by computing <em>p</em> for a large 
          number of values of <em>d'</em> and finding the closest match 
          of these <em>p</em> values to <em>p<sub>est</sub></em>.
          The value of <em>d'</em> associated with this closest match
          to <em>p<sub>est</sub></em> is the maximum-likelihood
          estimate of <em>d'</em>. </p>

        <p> For example, let's say that a 3-AFC test yielded 4 correct
          responses out of 20. (This should happen about 10% of the time
          when <em>d'</em> is 0, and almost never when <em>d'</em> is
          1.) This yields <em>p<sub>est</sub></em> = 0.20. For the
          3-AFC test, a <em>d'</em> of 0 yields a probability of 0.33,
          and this is the minimum probability we can get from this test.
          Therefore, the closest probability we can get to 0.20 is 0.33,
          and the best estimate we have of <em>d'</em> in this case is
          0. Now let's say that instead of 4 correct responses, we get
          17 correct responses. This yields <em>p<sub>est</sub></em> =
          0.85. The <em>d'</em> that yields a probability of 0.85 is
          1.91, and so our best estimate of <em>d'</em> is 1.91. </p>

        <p> How good is this estimate of <em>d'</em>? That depends on
          how good our estimate is of <em>p<sub>est</sub></em>, which
          in turn depends on how close <em>C</em> is to the expected
          value of the binomial distribution associated with <em>d'</em>.
          The more atypical our result <em>C</em> is, compared with a
          large number of similar (but hypothetical) tests, the worse
          our estimate is. We will never know how good our estimate is,
          but we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence intervals</a> 
          to get some sense of the likely range of <em>d'</em> values. 
          Before getting to the confidence interval, we should define the 
          "<a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/population-mean/">population
            mean</a>". If we had measurements of <em>C</em> from every
          human on earth taking multiple tests, each with the true value
          of <em>d'</em>, we could compute the mean value of <em>C</em>
          associated with <em>d'</em> over all humans; this mean is the
          population mean (taken over the entire population of interest,
          which in our case is presumably the population of all humans).
          The population mean is what we think the "true" mean is. The
          one measured value of <em>C</em> that we have from our trial
          is called the sample mean. </p>

        <p> A confidence interval (CI) specifies a range of values for,
          in our case, the expected number of correct responses, <em>C</em>.
          In particular, if one were to conduct the same experiment
          again with the same number of subjects and otherwise identical
          circumstances, the 95% confidence interval says that 
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5635437/">95%
            of the time that one does such an experiment, the confidence
            interval will contain the population mean</a>. 
          Once we have a lower limit and upper limit for the expected number 
          of correct responses (based on the confidence interval), we can 
          compute the lower and upper limit for the proportion of correct 
          responses (by dividing by the number of subjects), and we can use 
          the same technique to map from a probability of success to 
          <em>d'</em>. We can therefore use the low and high estimates of 
          <em>C</em> to determine the low and high values of <em>d'</em> 
          associated with the confidence interval. </p>

        <p> There are many ways to compute a confidence interval. My
          favorite is the 
          "<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading24.pdf">bootstrap confidence interval</a>". 
          It has the advantages of not making assumptions about the 
          underlying 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions">distribution of the data</a>, 
          it doesn't assume that the interval is symmetric around the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_estimation">point estimate</a>, 
          and it's very easy to implement on a computer.  The worksheet 
          below uses bootstrapping to compute the confidence interval. </p>

        <p> <a href="#Worksheet8">Worksheet 8</a>, below, is very similar 
          to <a href="#Worksheet7">Worksheet 7</a>. In addition to specifying 
          the number of correct responses, there is a field for specifying 
          the confidence interval. The default value, 95%, should be suitable 
          for most cases. On the right-hand side, under 
          <b><em>d'</em> Estimates:</b>, there are three rows. The first 
          row shows the 
          (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation">maximum-likelihood</a>,
          or ML) estimate of <em>d'</em> based on the number of correct
          responses. The second row shows the lower estimate of expected
          correct responses based on the specified confidence interval,
          followed by the <em>d'</em> value associated with this number
          of correct responses. The third row shows the higher estimate
          of expected correct responses based on the confidence
          interval, along with the associated <em>d'</em>. The graph
          has a vertical gray bar showing the value of <em>C</em>, as
          in Figures 6 and 7, and also a lighter-gray area illustrating
          the estimated range of correct values specified by the
          confidence interval. </p>

        <h2 id="Section11">11. Conclusion</h2>
        <p> This tutorial has presented a number of techniques for
          evaluating whether two stimuli are perceptually different or
          not. If you're a fan of 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>, 
          then go ahead and use only H0 and <i>alpha</i> in your analysis. 
          (If you're really a fan, then 
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4347431/">be flexible with <i>alpha</i></a>.) 
          If you prefer the 
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4347431/">hybrid Fisher and Neyman-Pearson approach</a> 
          described in <a href="#Section7">Section 7</a>,
          then use beta and the power of the test. If it makes you
          uncomfortable to consider rejecting H1, then don't attempt it.
          (If you do consider rejecting H1, then be clear about this
          option before starting the test.) If you don't object to
          likelihood ratios, maximum likelihood estimates, or confidence
          intervals, then use them. If you think that confidence intervals
          are the way to go and that NHST has too many flaws, then use
          only confidence intervals. The purpose of these different
          analyses isn't to prove anything, it is to convince your
          intended (and probably skeptical) audience that your conclusions
          are supported by the data. The different methods of analysis
          provide different tools for that purpose.</p>

        <p> The combination of NHST, likelihood ratios,
          maximum-likelihood estimates, and confidence intervals allows
          us to construct a nuanced interpretation of a test result.
          NHST allows us to (sometimes) come to a clear conclusion about
          the result but it provides no assessment of the merit of a
          hypothesis. Likelihood ratios and maximum-likelihood estimates
          provide us with specific estimates about different
          possibilities, but they don't tell us how accurate those
          estimates are. The use of a confidence interval on the
          maximum-likelihood estimate of <em>C</em> and <em>d'</em>
          provides a range of plausible values, but this interval may be
          too large to be useful by itself. By analyzing a test result
          in multiple ways, we can get a more complete picture of what
          the result tells us. The one thing to keep in mind is that we
          should specify our analysis techniques, hypotheses, and the
          criteria for success before conducting the experiment. </p>

        <p> I've avoided talking about prior probabilities, i.e. the
          probabilities that H0 and H1 are true before conducting the
          experiment. Such probabilities can give us an even better
          picture of our data if we have them. In some fields it may be
          possible to estimate these probabilities; for example, 
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4448847/#RSOS140216C7">there may be only a 10% chance of a clinical trial being successful</a>,
          and so p(H0) is 0.90 and p(H1) is 0.10. For perceptual testing, 
          I'm not sure that these probabilities can be estimated very well 
          in the general case, and so I've left them, and the whole world of 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics">Bayesian estimation</a>, 
            out of this tutorial. </p>

        <p> It has been commented that 
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6945059/">researchers should publish not just the results that show success, but all results</a>. 
          When simply testing H0, the story that "we did all this work and 
          can conclude nothing" is not very interesting to the writer, the 
          reviewer, or the reader. However, being able to say "we did all 
          this work and can conclude that H0 is 5 times more likely than H1" 
          is potentially more interesting and potentially more publishable.  
          Or, saying that the experiment did not demonstrate significance 
          with the available number of subjects but that the estimated value 
          of <em>d'</em> is 1.46 may provide useful information to future 
          researchers. One advantage of using likelihood ratios and 
          maximum-likelihood estimates is that all results become, at some 
          level, interesting and therefore potentially publishable. </p>

        <p> At the beginning of this tutorial, we asked a simple question:
          "Is there a perceptual difference between the two stimuli?".
          Hopefully it is clear now that there is very rarely a definitive 
          answer to this question. We can only answer it in terms of 
          probabilities that need to be evaluated within the context of 
          the testing procedure.  With a small number of subjects, the 
          amount of uncertainty in the results may be large.  With a very 
          large number of subjects, we have better confidence in our
          estimates and conclusions, but we need to be sure that the
          result is meaningful as well as significant.  For example,
          we may be confident that <em>d'</em> is 0.25, but simply
          rejecting the hypothesis that <em>d'</em> is zero doesn't mean
          that a value of 0.25 is perceptually important.  Finally, all
          of these analysis methods are only as good as the models they are 
          built upon, and different assumptions in the models or details
          of the test procedures can lead to different results.  Therefore, 
          it's important to understand the test results within the context 
          of both the testing details and the model assumptions. </p>
